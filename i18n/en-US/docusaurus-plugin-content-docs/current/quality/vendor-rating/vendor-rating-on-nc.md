:::important Purpose
Periodic *Periodic Ratings on Non-Compliance* is one of the methods available for vednor rating.   
This "objective" method is based on the weight of defects assigned to *Supplier Non-Compliance* and is usually used for periodic ratings.   

The management allows you to enter new *Periodic Ratings on Non-Compliance* or to search for existing ones to view them.

## Data Management


### Periodic Ratings on Non-Compliance

This is the list where the main information of *Periodic Ratings on Non-Compliance* is displayed.   
The list consists of the following information:   
> **From valuation date**: this is the start date of the rating period. The information is read-only.   
> **To valuation date**: this is the end date of the rating period. The information is read-only.   
> **Supplier**: this is the name of the evaluated *Supplier*. The information is read-only.   
> **Bonus**: this is the starting value of the *Bonus* associated with the *Supplier*. The information is read-only.   
> **Residual Bonus**: this is the final value of the *Bonus* after the assessment. The information is read-only.   
> **Score %**: this is the percentage value between *Residual Bonus* and *Initial Bonus*. The information is read-only.   
> **Valuation**: this is the *Valuation* given to the *Supplier* based on the *Score %* obtained. The information is read-only.   
> The cell is colored with the *background* and *text* colors specified in the *vendor ratings* table.   
> If the *valuation* attributed is associated with a *Vendor Rating* with *Automatic Suspension*, the evaluated *Supplier* will be *Suspended* from the *Rating Date*.
> The restoration of the suspension must be done manually by the designated *Company Function*.   
> **Notes**: free annotations.   


### Non-Compliance Values in the Period

This is the list of various *Severities* identified during the evaluated period.   
The list consists of the following information:   
> **Severity**: this is the code of the *Severity*.   
> **Severity description**: this is the description of the *Severity*.   
> **Count**: this is the number of counted *Severities*.   
> **Severity score**: this is the *Score for supplier qualification index calculation* associated with the *Severity*.   
> **Total computed score**: this is the sum of all *Score for supplier qualification index calculation (**IQF Score**)* multiplied together.   


:::tip Method used for calculation   
Method used for the calculation of: **Total computed score**, **Residual Bonus**, **Score %**, and **Valuation**.   
- Each individual row of *Non-Compliance Defect* entered in the evaluated period and attributed to the evaluated *Supplier* is considered.   
- For each row of *Defect Detected*, each individual *IQF Score* of: *Defect Detected*, *Effective Cause*, or *Alleged Cause* (in the absence of an associated *Effective Cause*), *Proposed Solution*, and *Decision Taken* is multiplied. If any of these data are not entered, the *IQF Score* equals **1.0**. Example:   
  - row 1: *IQF Defect Detected* = **5.1**, *IQF Effective Cause* = **1.5**, *IQF Proposed Solution* = **1.3**, and *IQF Decision Taken* = **2.1**;   
  the total for row 1 is: **5.1 * 1.5 * 1.3 * 2.1 = 20.8845** = *Total Row 1*.   
  - row 2: *IQF Defect Detected* = **2.1**, *IQF Alleged Cause* = **4.2** (*Effective Cause* not inserted), *Proposed Solution* not inserted so *IQF* = **1.0**, and *IQF Decision Taken* = **1.7**;   
  the total for row 2 is: **2.1 * 4.2 * 1.0 * 1.7 = 14.994** = *Total Row 2*.   
- The Total calculated score for each row is summed with the others that have the same *Severity*. The sum of all scores per row is the *Total calculated score* for that *Severity*. Example:   
  - **Total computed score** = *Total Row 1* + *Total Row 2* = **20.8845 + 14.994 = 35.8785**.   
- To calculate the *Residual Bonus*, we consider an initial *Bonus* for the *Supplier* of **500**. Thus:   
    - **Residual Bonus** = **Bonus** - sum of **Total computed scores** for each *Severity* = **500 - 35.8785 = 464.1215**.   
- To calculate the *Score %*, it is the application of the percentage between *Residual Bonus* and *Initial Bonus*:   
    - **Remaining Bonus** / **Bonus** * 100 = **464.1215 / 500 * 100 = 92.8243%**.   
- The **Valuation** is attributed based on the *Score from* values indicated in the *Score Ranges for Rating* list available in the *Vendor Qualification Parameters*. The *Valuation* with *Score from* immediately below the **Score %** is considered.
