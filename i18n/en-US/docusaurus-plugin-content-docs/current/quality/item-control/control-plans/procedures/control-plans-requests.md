:::important Purpose
This procedure allows for assigning the Requests generated during the association of Control Plans to the Item Controls where such association was not possible. Once the Control is associated with the Plan, the tests of the Control Plan will be automatically proposed to the Item Control.
To utilize the *Association*/*Insertion* function, it is necessary:   
- from the **Requests** tab, choose the lines of *Item Controls*;  
- from the **Control Plans** tab, choose the *Control Plans*;      
- click the **New Control Plan** or **Associate Control Plan** button.
