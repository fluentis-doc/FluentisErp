:::important What is it for
This management allows for the mass handling of many of the information in the *Data Sheets* without the need to manually enter each *Control Plan*.   
:::

The form is divided into:
- a filter area, contextual to the sessions of the information you wish to change;   
- an area composed of different tabs, each containing grids dedicated to modification and filter results;   
- the last tab contains the *Error Found* encountered during *Modification* activities.   

The tabs are:   
> **Control Plans**;   
> **Planned Tests**;   
> **Associated Items**.

### Specific Buttons

#### ![](/img/neutral/common/search.png) Search 

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display results within the results grid. The filter area is variable and contextual to the selected tab. The result of applying the filter will display data in the results grid of the previously selected tab.   

#### ![](/img/neutral/common/delete.png) Delete 

Enabled if at least one row is selected from the results grid.   
After selecting the desired rows, you need to click the **Delete** button to remove them, after confirmation.   

#### ![](/img/neutral/common/execute.png) Data Modification 

Enabled if at least one row is selected from the results grid.   
After selecting the desired rows and indicating the changes to be made in the results grid, you need to click the **Modify** button to apply the changes.   
In case of anomalies encountered during the *Modification*, reports are available in the *Error Found* tab.   

### Data Management

#### Filter Area 

The area consists of a fixed part where the search filters related to the header information of the *Control Plan* are reported and a variable part contextual to the selected tab; the variable part is contained in an expander that shows the same title as the selected tab; this variable part is not displayed for the *Control Plans* tab.   
By pressing the **Search** button, results are displayed within the results grid of the selected tab.  

#### Modification Area 

Contained in each tab (except in the *Error Found* tab), it is the upper "grid" composed of a single row.   
In this grid, which displays the same columns as the results grid (the lower one), it is possible to enter all the information you wish to report in the rows of the results grid upon pressing the *Modify* button.   
Once the replacement of values is finished, the pre-existing values in the upper grid will be deleted.   

#### Results Area 
Contained in each tab, it is the lower "grid" that contains the result of the *Search* applied to the filter area.   
In this grid, which displays the same columns as the modification grid (the upper one), you can manually modify all information without having to enter each management of the *Control Plan*. The columns vary depending on the selected tab.   
The columns where information cannot be modified are disabled and highlighted with a different color.
