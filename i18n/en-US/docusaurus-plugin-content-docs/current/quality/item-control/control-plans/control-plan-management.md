:::important What itâ€™s for
In Control Plans, all planned tests, verifications, necessary measurements, and values to be obtained are cataloged to ensure that materials and associated products fall within the limits of the required properties.   
Through Control Plans, it is possible to predefine the checks to be carried out during the lifecycle of an item: from incoming materials checks, returns from subcontracted work, to checks during the production cycle of an item: before, during, and after the product creation.  
Control Plans, just like Data Sheets, can be customizable for Customer and/or Supplier. This document also manages revisions and traceability among desired Control Plans.   
For each planned test, it is possible to indicate: whether the test is performed internally or by third parties, the category and measurement tool to be used, the types of required values (Yes/No or Numeric), the typical value, the lower and upper limits which can be specified in percentage or absolute value, the number of measurements to be taken, and how frequently.   

Here are some examples of possible types of Control Plans: Incoming checks, Incoming checks for critical suppliers, Production checks, Final tests.   

A standard report is available for: **Control Plan**.

## Command Buttons


### ![](/img/neutral/common/save.png) Save

Pressing this button saves all modified information of the *Control Plan* displayed.   


### ![](/img/neutral/common/duplicate.png) Duplicate Control Plan

It is possible to duplicate the displayed *Control Plan* into a new *Control Plan*. Simply press the **Duplicate** button.   
A request is displayed for:
> **Control plan type**: it is the *Control plan type* of the new *Control Plan* (mandatory data).   
> The *Control plan type* of the origin *Control Plan* is proposed.   
> **Number**: it is the sequential *Number* of the new *Control Plan* (mandatory data).   
> It is proposed based on what is provided by the *Numeration* associated with the *Control plan type* and the current date.   
> **Duplicate with traceability**: indicates whether to maintain the relationship/traceability of the destination *Control Plan* in the origin *Control Plan*, particularly in the *Related Control Plans tab*.   

Then press the **OK** button or the **Cancel** button if you wish to proceed with the duplication activity or not.   
At the end of the process, the new *Control Plan* is displayed.   

### ![](/img/neutral/common/execute.png) Create new revision

To create a new *Revision* of an existing *Control Plan*, it is necessary to press the **Create new edition** button.   
A new *Control Plan* is created, with all the information from the origin *Control Plan*, but with an incremented *Revision* index and a *Start validity date* equal to the current date.   
The origin *Control Plan* ends its validity by automatically setting the *End validity date* equal to the current date.   
At the end of the process, the new *Revision* of the *Control Plan* is displayed.   



### Create new Data Sheet

From the *Control Plan*, it is possible to create a *Data Sheet*; to do so, it is necessary to press the **Create new Data Sheet** button.   
A new *Data Sheet* is created, with all the information from the origin *Control Plan* but with a *Revision* index equal to *zero* and with a *Start validity date* equal to the current date. A request will be displayed for:   
> **Sheet type**: it is the *Sheet type* of the new *Data Sheet* (mandatory data).   
> **Client**: it is the *Client* of the new *Data Sheet*, the *Client* account of the origin *Control Plan* is proposed (only if it is of *Client account type*).   
> **New code**: it is the *Code* of the new *Data Sheet* (mandatory data), proposed based on what is provided by the *Encoding Method* associated with the *Data Sheet type*.   
> **Rev.**: it is the *Revision index* of the new *Data Sheet* (mandatory data), proposed as *zero*.   
> **Create maintaining traceability**: indicates whether to maintain the relationship/traceability in the destination *Data Sheet* with the origin *Control Plan*, particularly in the *Related Sheets tab*.   

Then press the **OK** button or the **Cancel** button if you wish to proceed with the creation activity or not.   
At the end of the process, the new *Data Sheet* is displayed.   


### ![](/img/neutral/common/duplicate.png) Duplicate Test

In conjunction with the *Planned Tests* tab, the button is enabled only if, from the *Planned Tests* list, a single *Test* row has been selected.  
All the information from the origin *Planned Test* is duplicated in a new *Planned Test* appended in *Sequence* to the already existing *Planned Tests*.
