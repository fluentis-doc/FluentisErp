:::important What it is for
The *Disclaimers* are clauses under which the company does not assume responsibility, for example due to misuse, for damages caused by or to the item. In disclaimers, the causes that invalidate the declared properties of the product can therefore be defined.

An example of use can be found in the **Product Sheet** printout executable from the **Report Data Sheet**.
