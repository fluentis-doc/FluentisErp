:::important What it is for
This procedure allows for the bulk management of certain information present in the *Technical Sheets*, without the obligation to enter each document, make the desired changes, and save them.
:::


The form is divided into:
- a filter area related to the search for header information of *Technical Sheets*;  
- a filter area related to the sessions of the information that you wish to modify;
- an area comprised of various tabs, each containing grids dedicated to modification and the results of the filter;   
- the last tab contains the *Errors Found* encountered during modification activities.   

The tabs are:   
> **Data Sheets**;   
> **Properties**;   
> **Norms & Laws**;   
> **Associated Items**.

### Specific buttons

#### ![](/img/neutral/common/search.png) Search

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to view the results within the results grid. The filter area is variable and contextual to the selected tab. The result of applying the filter will display data in the results grid of the previously selected tab.   

#### ![](/img/neutral/common/delete.png) Cancel

Enabled if at least one row is selected from the results grid.   
Once the desired rows are selected, you need to click the **Cancel** button to remove them, upon confirmation.   

#### ![](/img/neutral/common/execute.png) Data Modification 

Enabled if at least one row is selected from the results grid.   
Once the desired rows are selected and the changes to be made are indicated in the results grid, you must click the **Modify** button to apply the changes.   
In case of anomalies encountered during the *Modification*, the reports are available in the *Errors Found* tab.   

### Data Management 

#### Filter Area 

The area consists of a fixed part where the search filters related to the header information of the *Data Sheet* are displayed, and a variable part contextual to the selected tab; the variable part is contained in an expander that bears the same title as the selected tab; this variable part is not visible for the *Data Sheets* tab.   
Pressing the **Search** button displays the results within the results grid of the selected tab.  

#### Modification Area 

Contained in each tab (except in the *Errors Found* tab), it is the upper "grid" composed of a single row.   
In this grid, which displays the same columns as the results grid (the lower one), you can enter all the information you wish to display in the rows of the results grid upon pressing the *Modify* button.   
Once the replacement of values is completed, the existing values in the upper grid will be deleted.   

#### Results Area 
Contained in each tab, it is the lower "grid" that contains the result of the *Search* applied to the filter area.  
In this grid, which displays the same columns as the modification grid (the upper one), you can manually modify all information without needing to enter each management of the *Data Sheet*. The columns vary depending on the selected tab.   
The columns where information cannot be modified are disabled and highlighted in a different color.
