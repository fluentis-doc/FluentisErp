The report execution filter is located along the path **Quality > Item Controls > Data Sheets > Reports > Report Data Sheet**.   

:::important What it is for  
This print filter, unlike the print executable from the filter and the management of *Data Sheets* which allows printing of the general information of the *Sheet*, allows you to specify for which particular *Item* to print the information of the *Technical Data Sheet*.  
:::

The report execution filter allows you to search for *Items* present in the *Data Sheets* for printing.   
The default report is **Product Details** - *Data Sheet of the Item*, which lists the *Properties* indicated in the *Data Sheet*.   

### ![](/img/neutral/common/search.png) Search Data Sheets 
The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results in the *Data Sheets* results grid (left list).   

From the results grid of the *Data Sheets*, it is necessary to select a single desired *Data Sheet* to view, in the *Items* results grid (right list), the list of *Items* associated with it.   

From the *Items* results grid, it is necessary to select the *Items* that you wish to print.   

At the bottom of the standard **Product Details** print, the *Disclaimer* of the associated *Disclaimer Type* for the *Item* is also provided. If not specified, the *Disclaimer* of the *Disclaimer Type* indicated in *Disclaimer type to be printed* in case the article is lacking* will be displayed.
