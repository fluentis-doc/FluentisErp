:::important Purpose
Corrective actions are measures taken to resolve problems or deviations in processes and prevent their recurrence. They are implemented after identifying a problem, analyzing the root cause, and making changes to improve future performance. They are essential for maintaining and improving quality and efficiency in business processes.   
*Corrective Actions* must:   
- be appropriate to the effects of the identified non-compliances;   
- ensure that non-compliances do not recur;   
- examine the effectiveness of the implemented corrective actions.

A standard report is available for:   
> **Corrective Action Sheet**: form for the *Corrective Action*.
