They are implemented after identifying a problem, analyzing the root cause, and making changes to improve future performance. They are fundamental for maintaining and improving quality and efficiency in business processes.

## Getting Started 

**Corrective Actions**:
- you need to define a [*Corrective Action Type*](/docs/configurations/tables/quality/corrective-actions/corrective-action-type) and related *Numeration*   
- to facilitate the management of *Corrective Actions* set up the [*Corrective Action Parameters*](/docs/configurations/parameters/quality/corrective-actions)   
- you must enter a new [*Corrective Action*](/docs/quality/corrective-actions/corrective-action-management)   


## Links to Other Modules 
From the [*Complaints and Non-compliance*](/docs/quality/claims-and-non-compliance/claim-and-non-compliance-intro) module, particularly from the management of: [*Compliants*](/docs/quality/claims-and-non-compliance/claims/claim) and [*Non-compliance*](/docs/quality/claims-and-non-compliance/non-compliances/non-compliance), it is possible to generate *Corrective Actions*.
