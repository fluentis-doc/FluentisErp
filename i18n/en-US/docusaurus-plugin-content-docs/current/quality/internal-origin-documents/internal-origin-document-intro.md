        <p>The management of internal origin documents allows for: cataloging, management of editions/revisions, and their distribution (both in paper and electronic format) to the business functions that need to view these documents.</p>
        <p>Here are some examples of external origin documents that can be cataloged: *Quality Manual*, *Management Policy*, *Organizational Chart*, *Process Scheme*, *Operational Instructions*, *Service Sheet*, etc.</p>
        <p>The information on where the originals are stored and the possibility of attaching electronic copies allows for immediate traceability and consultation with a simple click of the mouse.</p>
        <p>Standard reports are available for: *Guard Page*, *Internal Document*, and *Documents attached to the document management system*.</p>
