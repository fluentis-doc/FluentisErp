The non-compliance valorization procedure allows for the creation of a debit note to a customer. 
To use the procedure, it is necessary that the Supplier account to which the product is contested is associated with a Customer account to which the invoice should be addressed. 
The procedure consists of three tabs.

## Valorization
In this tab, it is possible to select the non-compliance to be valued. It is possible to filter the results with the available filters to perform a more targeted search. 
The invoice will be created with the **Creation Date** present at the bottom of the form. 
After selection, the procedure is launched with the **Creating invoices from non-compliance** button on the ribbon bar.

## Parameters 
In this tab, it is possible to enter parameters to be used in the procedure. 
The **Non-compliances with different exchanges** flag allows for entering non-compliances with different exchanges on the same invoice. 
The **Insert non-compliance references** flag allows for including the reference on the invoice; it is possible to code the reference in the field below.

## Restore valorization
In this tab, it is possible to search for invoices previously created with the procedure. 
There are filters available to perform a more targeted search. 
In the first grid, the operations performed are listed, while in the second grid, the **Invoices** and **Non-compliance** for each operation are present. 
To cancel operations, it is necessary to select the operations to be deleted and click **Restore creation** on the ribbon bar. To cancel individual invoices among multiple invoices created in the same operation, it is necessary to select the invoices to be deleted in the second grid and click the **Restore invoice** button on the ribbon bar.
