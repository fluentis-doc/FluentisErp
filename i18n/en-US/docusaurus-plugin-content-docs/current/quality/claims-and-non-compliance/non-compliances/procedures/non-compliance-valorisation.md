The non-conformity valuation procedure allows for the simultaneous creation of one or more debit notes to the *Suppliers* for the desired *Non-Compliance*.   
To use the procedure, it is necessary that the *Supplier* account, to which the product or service is contested, is associated with a *Customer* account to which the invoice will be addressed.
