The Complaints valorization procedure allows for the simultaneous creation of one or more credit notes for the desired *Claims* senders.

## Valorization

You can search for *Claims* to be valued using the available filters.   
The *Claims* that can be searched are those that are *Authorized*, with a *Value to be credited* and not yet *Valorized*.   
The *Credit Notes* will be created with the **Creation Date** present below the list.   
By selecting one or more *Claims*, the valuation can be executed by pressing the **Creating Invoices from Complaints** button.

## Parameters
In the tabulator, it is possible to enter parameters to be used in the procedure and during the valuation in the management of the [Claim](/docs/quality/claims-and-non-compliance/claims/claim).  
The managed information is:

Once the parameters have been modified, to use them, it is necessary to save the changes by pressing the **Save** button.
