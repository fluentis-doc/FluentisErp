The management of **Job Order Generation** allows for the creation of work orders based on various inputs such as customer orders, sales forecasts, low stock, and warehouse needs.    
The user can configure various parameters to optimize the process by selecting relevant orders and setting specific criteria for production.         
This system facilitates the planning of production activities, allowing you to choose between different operating modes, such as mono or multiple product job orders, and to organize work based on defined priorities. It is also possible to update existing job orders or create new job orders based on specific procurement and distribution needs.        
The flexible approach to **Job Order Generation** helps ensure that production meets market needs and business priorities, optimizing resource management and improving overall operational efficiency.
