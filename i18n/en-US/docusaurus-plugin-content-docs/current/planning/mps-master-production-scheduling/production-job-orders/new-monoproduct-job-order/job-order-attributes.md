This tab consists of a grid and a small toolbar with 3 buttons. Through the grid the user can insert manually data from Encoder tables. The columns in the grid are the following:


 1. Attribute: through this column it is possible to recall the Encoder tables names thanks also to the use of the specific combo box
 2. Attribute Value: in this column it is possible to insert precodified data manually, by using tooltip or a help that can be explode thanks to a double click on the yellow box. The data come from the table that has been selected in the previous column. This happens only if the Encoder table has been created with the “tabular” encoding system and so through the precodified data insertion into table. Otherwise the attribute value has to be inserted into the other field manually, as follows
 3. Attribute Value: in this column the user can manually insert a value in order to be linked to the selected table into the “Attribute” column. In case of table without “tabular” encoding system the user is forced to insert an alphanumeric data into this column, otherwise it will not be possible to save the grid line
 4. Modifiable: in this column there is a flag that, if active, enables the user to decide which attribute in the Production Job Order can be edited by following a subsequent passage. For example, this can occur within the production order that is generated directly by that Production Job Order and also within the production order whose item is the same as the Production Job Order one

There is also a small toolbar, that has 3 buttons: the first one, starting from the left and identified with “P” icon, enables the user to insert automatically into the grid the same attributes with the same values of the Production Job Order previously created for the same customer; the second button, identified with “ART” icon, enables the user to insert automatically into the grid the same attributes with the same values of Items Register, “Other Data” tab, if available; the last button, on the right of the table, enables the user to view for the selected grid line further information related to the encode table data, that is Code, ID and possibly Description, if available.
