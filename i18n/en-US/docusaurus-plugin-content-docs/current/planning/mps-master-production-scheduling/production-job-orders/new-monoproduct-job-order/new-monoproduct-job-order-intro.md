The window, that enables the user to insert a New Monoproduct Job Order, can be opened through the following path Planning > Job Orders > New Monoproduct Job Order, or by clicking on the Ribbon icon from Job Orders window called exactly 'New Monoproduct Job Order'.

First of all the application needs the insertion of the Production Job Order Type, even if it proposes the predefined type as a default type into the specific combo box. After having indicating the job order type the user can insert the item to be produced into the specific box through help or by typing class and code manually. Then after having inserted the item to be produced the application enables the user to choose the item Variant and insert in the New Monoproduct Job Order window all the information about item. The data are contained within the 'Item Characteristics' section, where it is possible to view: the procurement type of the item inserted into Job Order (production, purchase or subcontractor), the production economic order quantity and its multiples, the production lead time and the percentage of scrap; the whole amount of this data are contained in the item MRP Parameters. Lastly the application needs the insertion of the Estimated End Date and of the Quantity to be produced into the following specific fields in order to save the job order.

The other data in the management window are the follwing:

**Year / Number**: in these fields it is possible to insert year and job order number that user is creating automatically and according to the numbering type linked to the job order type that has been inserted in the specific field. The user can also edit these data manually

**Status**: through this field it is possible to view and edit the Production Job Order status. The Job Order Status can be:

**Launched**: in case that at least one of the planned production or purchase orders, that have been generated during the General Scheduling procedure, is issued

**Executive**: in case that at least one of the production orders or one of the subcontractor planned orders is issued or when one of the Purchase Request lines is transformed into vendor order line

**Canceled**: in order to indicate that the initially planned job order wasn't processed, the user can set this status manually instead of delete the job order

**Suggested Date**: in case that the user has scheduled the job order by using the 'Control documents in delay with ATP' parameter and by having set a 'MS (Master Scheduling) Start Date' into the General Scheduling parameters, in this field it is possible to view the date that the system has suggested. The user has the chance to decide that the suggested date is the estimated job order end date
