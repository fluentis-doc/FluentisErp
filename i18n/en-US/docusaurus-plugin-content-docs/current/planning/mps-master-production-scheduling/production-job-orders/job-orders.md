Based on the status of the order (thus scheduled, executive, etc.), the line of the order will have a different color. The colors that can be matched to the status of the order are established within the [MPS Parameters](/docs/configurations/parameters/production/mps-parameters), in the *Job Order colors* section.

From this form, it is also possible to *create new orders*, both **monoproduct** and **multiproduct** by clicking on the respective buttons available in the *Ribbon Bar*: [Insert job order](/docs/planning/mps-master-production-scheduling/production-job-orders/new-monoproduct-job-order) and [Insert multiproduct job order](/docs/planning/mps-master-production-scheduling/production-job-orders/new-multiproduct-job-order).

By double-clicking on one of the orders present in the results grid, you will enter the details of the order, whose data will be further explored in the articles *Insert New Monoproduct Job Order* and *Insert New Multiproduct Job Order*.

The *Valorized* column, if the flag is active, indicates that the order already has at least one costing within it.

*Specific buttons*:

> **Duplicate Job Order**: allows you to duplicate the selected order;         
> **Change priority**: allows you to change the priority assigned to the order;
