The **CRP – Capacity Requirements Planning** module provides the ability to control the commitment of productive resources through several tools, such as **Work Center Capacity**, **Gantt Simulation**, and **Phase Sequence**, which allow for the analysis, modification, and rearrangement of planned production, purchasing, and subcontracting orders based on the needs of business management.

## To get started using 

**Work Center Capacity** and **Phase Sequence**:
- create items in the [*Item Register*](/docs/erp-home/registers/items/create-new-items/create-new-item) 
- create [*Bills of Materials*](/docs/erp-home/registers/production/bill-of-materials/search-and-insert-assemblies) 
- create [*Work Cycles*](/docs/erp-home/registers/production/routes/new-route) 
- create [*Work Centers*](/docs/erp-home/registers/production/routes/work-center) 
- create [*Factory Calendars*](/docs/configurations/tables/production/factory-calendar/) 
- create [*Production Capacity Calendars*](/docs/configurations/tables/production/productive-capacity-calendar/)
