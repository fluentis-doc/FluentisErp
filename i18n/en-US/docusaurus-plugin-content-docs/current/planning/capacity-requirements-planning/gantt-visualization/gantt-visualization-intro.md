:::important What it is for
The function of the **Gantt Chart** in Fluentis is an essential tool for planning and monitoring projects. It allows for a graphical visualization of scheduled activities, highlighting the timelines and relationships between the various phases of the project.     
Users can manage resources, adjust deadlines, and optimize production processes, enhancing operational efficiency and effectiveness. With an intuitive interface, the Gantt chart facilitates the identification of potential delays or bottlenecks, supporting proactive and strategic project management.

The **Gantt Chart** allows for a graphical representation of the positioning over time of the production order down to the detail of each individual processing phase and its progress. 
The tool enables managing multiple simulations without affecting the information of operational documents, until the moment one of them is confirmed.

In the search grid, it's possible to filter and view the generated simulations in a tree structure, where the parent is the main simulation, while the branches are the snapshots, thus the sub-simulations created by modifying the main simulation.

*Specific fields*:

> **Number**: indicates the number associated with the Gantt simulation;     
> **Name**: indicates the name associated with the Gantt simulation (by default, it proposes the user's name along with the date and time of creation);    
> **Insert Date**: indicates the insertion date of the Gantt simulation;      
> **Type**: indicates the code of the [Gantt Simulation Type](/docs/configurations/tables/production/crp-gantt-simulation-type);           
> **Type description**: indicates the description of the [Gantt Simulation Type](/docs/configurations/tables/production/crp-gantt-simulation-type);        
> **Block Document**: indicates that all documents included in the creation of the Gantt simulation are locked;  
> **Valid**: indicates that the simulation has been confirmed and thus the changes made in the Gantt have been reflected in the related documents;      
> **Snapshot**: if active, indicates that this is a *Gantt Simulation Type* of Snapshot type;
> **User**: indicates the user of the Gantt simulation.
