Through the Production Planning procedure, the company sets and organizes production strategies aimed at meeting delivery requirements for customers, which often conflict with the management and efficiency objectives of the production departments. Various techniques can be used in **Fluentis ERP** to establish a strategic Production Planning: MTO (Make to Order), MTS (Make to Stock), ATO (Assembly to Order), or ETO (Engineering To Order). Sometimes the needs can be mixed; therefore, the strategic choice of how to set the production flow effectively determines the company's ability to maintain a good balance between meeting demand and managing production supply.
