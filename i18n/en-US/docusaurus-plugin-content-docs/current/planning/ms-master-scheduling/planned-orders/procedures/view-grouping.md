The form allows you to search for all groupings in order to view or delete them.

In the filter area, it is possible to apply filters for item, variant, production job, production order, etc. With the appropriate flag, you can choose whether to also display groupings containing *Maintenance Orders*.

Once all desired filters have been set, simply click on the **Search** button present in the *ribbon bar* to view the results in the results grid.

To *open* the details of a grouping, simply select it and double-click with the mouse, or click on the **View** button.

Entering the view of the grouping you chose to select, a new form will open, consisting of an initial part with fields summarizing the main data of the *Grouping* and a results grid where you can view all the *Grouping Orders*.
