This form allows you to print a list of production orders, with the option to detail the view.

**Filters**

Apart from common filters, you can choose, via a specific flag, whether to display *Maintenance Orders* as well.

**Processing**

In this section, you can select via flags whether you want to display all production orders indiscriminately, or choose to display only expired or delayed orders.

**Sorting**

In this section, you can choose, using the appropriate flags, what to base the sorting of the data on within the printout. You can thus choose whether to sort the results by order number, item or item description, start date/end date, or by project.

**Details**

In this section, you can decide, using the appropriate flags, whether to display the list of materials contained in the order and the planned phases; you can also display the involved personnel and any related reports. Obviously, these details are only available for planned production and subcontracting orders.

**Order Status**

Finally, in this section, you can choose, using the appropriate flags, whether to display all orders regardless of their status, or only those with certain statuses, such as Launched, Executed, Completed, and Archived.

Once the various filter and display parameters are set, simply select the type of print you want to launch from the ribbon bar (only if multiple types are available) via the appropriate combo box, and then launch the print preview or directly print the document.
