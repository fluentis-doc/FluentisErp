**Fluentis ERP** allows for the management of Production and all its operational aspects within companies in the Manufacturing and Industrial sectors that need to handle even complex situations regarding estimation, cost accounting, materials, and activities. The **Fluentis** algorithms enable the management of all internal and external business processes throughout the entire product lifecycle, from estimation to design, procurement of materials and production resources, to internal Production Planning and/or Contract Work, to Production Data Collection and Cost Control, not to mention the integration perspective of Industry 4.0 for Production plants and Automatic Warehouses.

In Fluentis ERP, the application of the MES model has been designed by implementing a large number of parameters for the integrated management of data coming from production processes, which significantly influence the company's profitability. In the Fluentis MES software, we can notice how the documents related to production orders, which are actually launched but not necessarily executable, define the sequence by which, in each department, and even more specifically in each work center, all necessary information for carrying out the production activity is defined. The materials, phases and sub-phases, setups, and generally all supporting documentation are aimed at making the execution of the activity as automated, organized, and smooth as possible. The main algorithm of an ERP specialized in Production is defined by the MRP, the planning system that ensures the correct allocation of materials and resources needed to carry out production activities. The MRP algorithm is configured based on a substantial series of parameters to best adapt to the type of production reality represented by the company.
