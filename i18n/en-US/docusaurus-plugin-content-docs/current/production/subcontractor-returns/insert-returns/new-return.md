The window, which enables the user to insert a New Subcontractor Return, can be opened through the path Subcontractor > Returns > Search Returns > New Return, or clicking on the ribbon bar icon from window Search Subcontractor Returns called “Insert”.

First the application needs to insert the return Subcontractor using the help accounts in the Return header. After having specified the subcontractor, the user can insert manually the return delivery note number in “Delivery Note Number” field, the delivery note date in “Date” field, the date of the real return in “Effective Return Date” (that corresponds usually to the current date) and optionally even the Return Type. The insertion of the Return Type field, thanks to the special combo box, enables the user to monitor the warehouse in order to load return items from subcontractor who will be chosen according to what has already been inserted in “Returns Type” table previously. Otherwise the warehouse chosen in the item line will be taken by the subcontractor order to be executed.

In the return header there are even the flags “Controlled”, “Valorized”, “Loaded” mentioned before. It is important to notice that the “Controlled” field can be activated always manually by user, on the contrary the other 2 flags are automatically activate at the moment of the execution of document valorization and stock record.

Once having inserted the header data the user has to save document thanks to the special “Save” button on the ribbon bar. Consequently it is possible to activate the “Estimated Returns” button, which opens a second window called “Execution from Order”, in which user can view all the subcontractor orders that have some partially or totally not executed lines and from which it is possible to generate the returns.

Working on this window the user can select and transfer the lines of those items that he wants to insert in the just generated subcontractor return. At this point the user can close the execution  window, return to the New Return window and complete the information about the same return (lots, serial numbers, warehouse and return template, working cost, etc…), using the following tabs.
