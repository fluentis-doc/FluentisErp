This form allows you to print the report **Production Progress Check (Verifica avanzamento di produzione)** which shows the progress status of individual phases for each production order via a *progress bar*, based on time or quantity produced.

The report includes a field *State* that indicates the status of the phase with a colored square having the following meanings:

- **Green**: indicates that the phase is not delayed;       
- **Red**: indicates that the phase is delayed;        
- **Gray (Grigio)**: indicates that the phase is completed.

The **Progress Percentage (Percentuale di avanzamento)** of the phase in the chart is calculated based on the sum of produced and rejected quantities in the production declarations, or based on the greater value between the sum of machine times and the sum of labor times. The user can choose the valuation criterion for the **Progress Percentage (Percentuale di avanzamento)** via the appropriate flags present in the *Estim. end work* box in the report filter.       
If the **Progress Percentage (Percentuale di avanzamento)** exceeds 100%, a *Red triangle (Triangolino rosso)* will be shown next to the chart, indicating the exceeding of the planned value.
