This form allows you to print the report of the *Worksheet* for production orders or directly for the phases (if considering the work center); thus, it gives the opportunity to print by production order or by individual phase. Once the print command is executed, the **Already Printed (Gi√† stampato)** flag is activated for each printed phase or production order.

Additionally, the **Definitive** flag present in the *Filter for pages already printed*, if activated, sets the *Final Print (Stp. def.)* flag on the order of production phase line indicating that the final print of the worksheet report has been completed.
