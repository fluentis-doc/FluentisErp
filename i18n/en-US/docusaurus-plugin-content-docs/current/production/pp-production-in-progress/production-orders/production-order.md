title: Production Orders 
sidebar_position: 3
---

Normally, production orders are automatically generated by the *Release Planned Orders* procedure. 
To manually create a production order, it is necessary to first create the planned production order and then release it through the dedicated procedure.

## Production Order Header 

In the header, all data regarding the production order is summarized, such as: number, lot, and year, the data of the job and the reference customer, the connected project, start and end date, information related to the item to be produced, with the bill of materials version and cycle, quantity to be produced and produced.  
It is also possible to specify the warehouse and the reason, which will be used for the loading of the finished product into the warehouse; these will have maximum priority over all other parameters as explained in detail in the [Production Parameters](/docs/configurations/parameters/production/production-orders-parameters/production-orders-parameters-intro).

*Specific buttons:*  

> **Complete Orders Data**: calls the procedure that allows entering and/or updating all data related to materials, phases, setup, equipment, attributes, and various notes for the article entered in the production order, pulling them from the bill of materials and routing of the article and **valid at the data execution of data completion**.
> **Recalculate Initial Date**: Calls the procedure that allows updating the start date of the production order and, if necessary, the processing phases as a result of a change in processing times and/or the quantity to be produced for the article subject to the production order.
> **Generate Bill of Materials**: allows generating the bill of materials based on the data entered in the production order or updating existing data with those entered in the order.  
> **Generate Work Cycle**: allows creating the work cycle of the article based on the data entered in the order, or updating existing data with those entered in the order.  

*Specific fields:*  

**State**: indicates the status of the production order: *Launched* is the initial state of the production order just generated by the planned order release procedure, while *Executive* is the status to be assigned to the order in order to proceed with production reporting.

**Mandatory**: by enabling this flag, the production order becomes mandatory, thus, the [Finite Capacity Scheduling](/docs/planning/ms-master-scheduling/finite-capacityscheduling) will not reposition it over time and will keep it fixed on those dates. Furthermore, this will also be taken into account by the [M.R.P.](/docs/planning/ms-master-scheduling/mrp) procedure when the flag *Differentiate confirmed production request* is active.

## Materials

In this tab, the first-level materials of the bill of materials related to the finished product to be produced are reported, but the user can modify the data and/or add additional materials to the list of components of the production order.  
To import data directly from the bill of materials of the article, it is necessary to click on the **Complete Orders Data** button present in the ribbon bar.

*Specific buttons:*

> **Insert Material**: allows inserting a new material into the grid;  
> **Delete materials**: allows deleting the materials entered in the grid. 

*Specific fields:*

**Class**: Indicates the class of the item;       
**Item Code**: indicates the code of the item;          
**Variant**: in this field, any variant of the item is entered;               
**MU**: in this field, the primary unit of measure of the item is reported; 
**Units of Measure**: in this field, the alternative unit of measure of the article is inserted;  
**Usage date**: coincides with the expected start date of the phase of the production order to which that material is associated; if it is not associated with any phase, it coincides with the start of the first phase of the cycle;
**Usage Quantity**: represents the unit quantity needed for this item (as specified by the [Bill of Materials](/docs/erp-home/registers/production/bill-of-materials/assemblies/structure-management)) which can still be modified;  
**Total Quantity**: represents the quantity obtained by multiplying the *Usage Quantity* by the *Quantity to be produced*;      
**Alternative Quantity**: represents the total quantity but expressed in the alternative unit of measure;  
**Quantity picked**: represents the quantity picked via the [Picking List](/docs/production/pp-production-in-progress/picking-materials-list);      
**Fixed / Variable**: indicates whether the quantity of material is fixed or variable, this is inherited from the [Bill of Materials](/docs/erp-home/registers/production/bill-of-materials/assemblies/structure-management);              
**Scrap%**: in this box, the potential scrap percentage for this item is entered or retrieved from the [Bill of Materials](/docs/erp-home/registers/production/bill-of-materials/assemblies/structure-management);
**Phase / Subphase**: with a double click, a help window for processing phases opens from which the relevant phase and subphase can be selected, and then assign the selected material to a specific processing phase of the article;  
**Warehouse**: indicates the warehouse from which this item will be shipped;       
**Reason**: indicates the reason for the warehouse that will be used to ship this item;    
**Priority**: here the priority of the component is displayed, if present, entered in the [Bill of Materials](/docs/erp-home/registers/production/bill-of-materials/assemblies/structure-management). This contributes to the uniqueness of the material, so the same material can be entered multiple times with different priorities. Additionally, it can be manually modified, like all other data present in this grid;      
**Available quantity**: in this field, the available quantity of the item appears, given by the **Recalculate Feasibility** procedure present in [Phase Sequences](/docs/planning/capacity-requirements-planning/phase-sequences/phase-sequence-topdown);           
**To declare on mobile**: if enabled, the material will be automatically suggested in the production declaration form present on the WMS.

## Phases

In this tab, the phases of the work cycle related to the finished product to be produced are reported, but the user can modify the data and/or add additional phases to the production order.  
To import data directly from the routing of the article, it is necessary to click on the **Complete Orders Data** button present in the ribbon bar. In the production order, a phase can be changed from internal to external, thus allowing the entry of the subcontractor, and upon saving, the procedure will create the work order. Moreover, if an external phase is converted into internal, the procedure will automatically delete the associated work order.

*Specific buttons:*  
> **Insert phase**: allows inserting a new phase into the grid;  
> **Delete phase**: allows deleting the phases entered in the grid. 

*Specific fields:*

**Phase Code / Phase / Subphase**: with a double click, the relevant help for processing phases opens from which the corresponding phase and subphase can be selected;  

**Quality Control**: if enabled, this flag indicates that this phase is subject to quality control, and in the specific tab, you can indicate the *Control Plan* that will be used to verify the item after the production declaration is made;     
**Production Phase**: if active, indicates that the phase is productive, and you can proceed with entering production reports (thus activating it means you want the production for this phase to be recorded); if not active, it will not be possible to declare the phase itself;         
**Movable Phase**: if active, indicates that when the production phase is recorded, inventory movements are also created; this means that proceeding with the production report will also lead to the loading of the finished product into inventory and the unloading of the raw material used for production in that phase;     
**Work Center**: indicates the work center, i.e., the machine where that specific phase will take place;     
**Fixed Time**: if enabled, indicates that the time for that phase is fixed and therefore not variable based on quantity; this is inherited from the entered work center;     
**Phase Quantity**: indicates the total quantity of pieces to be produced in that phase;        
**Estimated start/end date**: these are the start and end dates of the respective phase; changing the estimated start and end processing dates will automatically modify these as well. They are calculated based on the times entered in the processing phases, and more precisely based on the greater of the total worker time and the total machine time for the selected phase;        
**Total Machine Time**: indicates the total machine time, resulting from the product of *machine time* by the *number of machines*;       
**Machine Time**: indicates the processing time of that machine for that phase;      
**Number of Machines**: indicates the number of machines used in that phase;     
**Total Worker Time**: indicates the total worker time, resulting from the product of *worker time* by the *number of workers*;     
**Worker Time**: indicates the processing time of the workforce for that phase;        
**Number of Workers**: indicates the number of workers employed in that phase;     
**Phase / Overlapped Subphase**: in these two fields, in the case of overlap, you will indicate the phase that you intend to overlap with the selected phase;
**Location**: allows you to associate a warehouse location with the phase; this means that all items used in that phase will be present in that location;     
**Subcontractor Description**: By double-clicking on the box, the help opens to select the account and detail account of the corresponding *subcontractor*. This box is active only if the phase is designated as *External*. It is worth noting that the *subcontractor* is also retrieved from the processing phase entered in the item's processing cycle;
**Work Order Created**: indicates that the work order has been created. It only works for external phases;        
**Work Center Description**: indicates the description of the work center for the phase;       
**Final Print**: indicates that the [Worksheet](/docs/production/pp-production-in-progress/reports/worksheet) has been definitively printed;   
**Worksheet Print Date**: indicates the date of printing of the [Worksheet](/docs/production/pp-production-in-progress/reports/worksheet) definitively;      
**Progressive Worksheet Number**: indicates the progressive number of the printed [Worksheet](/docs/production/pp-production-in-progress/reports/worksheet) definitively.      

In the **Property** tab, the following data related to the selected phase in the grid is displayed:

**Phase Description (Descrizione fase)**: indicates the description of the selected phase and sub-phase;
**Type**: in this combo, it is possible to set the type of processing (internal or external);  
**Overlap**: through this combo, I can insert the type of any overlap between phases. We can have *Total* overlap (in this case, the phase in question is completely overlapped with the indicated phase), *By pieces* (in this case, it is necessary to indicate after how many pieces produced by this phase the next phase will start), *By time* (in this case, it is necessary to indicate after how many minutes from when the indicated phase started the next phase will start);  
**Times MU**: in this combo box, the Time Unit of the Phase appears; one can decide to manage the times of the phase in seconds, minutes, hours, and days. Usually, internal phases are managed in minutes and external phases in days, but it obviously depends a lot on the type of company for which the work is being set up;  
**Machine**: in this combo, the code (and description) of the relevant machine can be selected. It is automatically proposed, retrieved from the work center that was previously entered in the grid;
**Production site**: indicates the production site where the item will be produced; this is inherited from the production order;
**Labour group**: in this combo, the code (and description) of the relevant labor group can be selected. It is automatically proposed, retrieved from the work center that was previously entered in the grid;  
**Quantity of pieces per phase**: indicates the number of pieces produced for each execution of that phase;
**Value**: here the value of any overlap is indicated, using the criteria specified above;  
**Using**: if the flag is activated, it means that the waiting / queue time will increase the commitment time of the Work Center on that phase;  
**Wait / queue time**: indicates the time that is necessary to wait at the end of the execution of the phase before being able to re-run it. Furthermore, by activating the flag **Use**, this waiting time will be considered as an additional commitment of the Work Center's time for that phase.
