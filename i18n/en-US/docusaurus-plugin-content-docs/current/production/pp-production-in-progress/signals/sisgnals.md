:::important What it is for
The module for **Production declarations** of Fluentis is an essential tool for effectively managing and monitoring the production cycle. Each declaration begins with an opening, followed by possible reports of progress, suspension, resumption, and closure of the process. Operators can easily enter crucial data such as quantities produced, discarded, materials used, involved personnel, and indicate batches and serial numbers, ensuring complete traceability of production operations; additionally, quality control is also integrated within them. This structured approach optimizes efficiency, improves activity control and resource management.
