In this tab it is possible to set the search criteria of the planned and production orders that user wants to view graphically in the Histogram of the second tab. There are 3 different modalities of setting filters. Indeed through the radio buttons, which are at the top of the window, user can decide to use “Filters” (and in this case the box at the bottom of the window is activated), “Work Centers” radio button (and in this second case only the grid, on which user can insert the work centers to view in graphic, is activated) and “All the work centers” radio button, which disables both previous sections, allowing the automatic visualization  of graphics for all work centers that are in the database of the company, in which user works.

User can use the following filters:


 1. Demand Type: in the graphic of this section user can view the planned and production orders on which every filtered work center works, or among the filtered ones, only the work centers with excess of occupation (that is the work centers that have working days where the available work quantity is less than the required one), or only the work centers with deficiency of occupation (that is the work centers that have some working days where the available work quantity is higher than the required one)
 2. From date…To date…: in these 2 fields user can set from which date to which date wants to view the planned and production orders situation. The graphic will specifically adapt according to the inserted date range
 3. Year / Planned Ord.: in these 2 fields there is the setting of year and number of the planned order, which user wants to view within graphic. Thanks to this radio button activation the user can use also the filter according to the planned order type, while all the other filters of the same section are automatically disabled
 4. Year / Prod. Order: in these 2 fields there is the setting of year and number of the production order, which user wants to view within graphic.
