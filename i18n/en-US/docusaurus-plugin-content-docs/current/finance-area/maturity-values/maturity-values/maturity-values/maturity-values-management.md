title: Maturity Values Management
sidebar_position: 1
---

This form is accessible only from the **Mat. Values** form (Finance > Mat. Values > Mat. Values).

Access can occur in two ways:

1. Through the command *New Maturity Value*
2. By double-clicking on a maturity present in the main grid of the *Search Maturity Values* form or selecting the row and using the Edit Maturity Value command in the ribbon bar.

From this position, it is possible to:

- manually enter a new maturity (without it being generated by an accounting entry)

- edit the data of an existing maturity.

In particular, typically, from this position, the maturity can be blocked or unblocked for payment by acting on the appropriate flag:

![](/img/it-it/finance-area/maturity-values/maturity-values/maturity-values-management/image01.png) 

adding the flag to block (the program will automatically add the date and the user who blocked it)

or removing it to unblock (at this point, the user who unblocked it will also appear).

**Payment detail account**: this detail account is associated with the created mat. values to check the flow of payments/collections in the reports of the schedules and in the cash flow simulations; it will therefore be filled in by entering the bank account of the company in use. The field will be automatically filled for mat. values created from ledger records if the appropriate field in the **[vendor register](/docs/erp-home/registers/contacts/create-new-contact/accounting-data/customer-vendors-data/finance)** is filled in.

**Agent**: the field is automatically filled for mat. values generated from the automatic accounting of sales invoices with the indication of the agent connected to the invoice itself. This information is useful for filtering mat. values in the search form and in the prints where the field is present.

**Scheduled date**: this field can be filled to support the processing of **[Cash Flow](/docs/treasury/cash-flow/cash-flow/cash-flow-management)** (a feature present in the treasury area). Thus, an expected collection or payment date can be indicated that differs from the due date of the maturity and will be reported in the cash flow processing (to which reference is made). In particular, it is noted that in the absence of a specific indication defined in the field in the comment, the expected date will be set in the cash flow processing, starting from the due date, adding the value (if present) contained in the **Late Days** field present in the customer or vendor register.

For other fields, see the **[Glossary](/docs/guide/common/glossary/glossary-intro)** and refer to the instructions related to the **[Mat. values Tab in the Ledger Record](/docs/finance-area/ledger-records/records/create-ledger-record/maturity-values-tab)**.

**NOTE:**

Generally, manual entry of mat. values is an extraordinary operation as mat. values originate from ledger records. It can be executed, for example, to manually enter some open mat. values resulting from data transfer from a previous management system (instead of using the mass import functionalities) or for other particular reasons.

If, simultaneously, for example, an opening accounting entry for a customer or vendor is entered, from the commented mask, it is possible to link the accounting entry through the appropriate command present in the ribbon bar, as described below.

## Grouped Mat. Values 

From the commented form, it is also possible to perform a sort of "grouping" of mat. values. That is, to the currently edited maturity, it is possible to group other mat. values (even if they are not addressed to the same subject). The command is located in the ribbon bar. **Add maturity values to be grouped**.

The result will be that:

- the grouped mat. values will no longer be visible in the maturity values search form

- the modified maturity will assume a value equal to its total plus the grouped mat. values

- the details of the mat. values that have been grouped with the modified one will appear in the commented grid.

**To add the mat. values that will be grouped, use the Add mat. values to be grouped command available in the ribbon bar.**

*Specific buttons*
> **Add mat. values to be grouped**: allows selecting other mat. values that will be grouped with the modified maturity;  
> **Delete Maturity Values to be Grouped**: deletes the selected maturity from the 'Grouped mat. values' grid, restoring its autonomy regarding the modified maturity (which is the only one visible compared to those grouped with it);  
> **Create from maturity values/payments / pagamenti**: allows creating a maturity from a payment. Useful for reconciling differences or offsetting. The command pulls up a search form for the payments from which to create the maturity. Typically executed immediately after manually creating a new maturity from the maturity values search form;  
> **Recording link**: allows linking the modified maturity to an accounting entry (useful if the maturity was created manually).

## Linked Payments 

## Extra Data 

The list of linked Extra Data is reported, with the possibility to add new extra data useful only for the specific document, with the option through the appropriate flag to choose which extra data to print.
