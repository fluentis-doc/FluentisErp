This form allows you to search for or manually enter payments.

Note that the Fluentis partial system requires that a payment is either open or closed, depending on whether it is NOT connected to a payment or if a payment is connected to it.

In this form, particularly in the filter area, the **Payments not attached to the maturity values** is highlighted, which is very useful diagnostically for identifying orphan payments without the relevant party and therefore considered inconsistent data to be corrected.

In the event that a payment is manually entered using the **New** command (a particular and generally atypical case, for example, to close an open payment extra-accounting), after opening the new payment entry form, the **Create from maturity values/payments / pagamenti** command is indicated, which allows you to search for the party to close while automatically creating the connected payment.

The **Recording Link** command is also useful for reconstructing the (missing) link between the payment and the related accounting entry if necessary.
