The report corresponding to this search functionality is also called **[Maturity Value Grouping.](/docs/finance-area/maturity-values/reports/maturity-value-grouping)**

**Detail account:** main filter for selecting the detail account related to the customer or vendor.

**Document No.:** filter for entering the document number (invoice, fiscal receipt, etc.) related to the maturity value group or the detail maturity values (by activating the flag **Search within group**).

**Group Type:** Open / Closed = Although the individual maturity values of the group may be open or closed by payments of opposite signs, the entire group is considered closed when all the maturity values are closed and the total debits and credits of the group balance. Therefore, this condition can be selected in the filter.
