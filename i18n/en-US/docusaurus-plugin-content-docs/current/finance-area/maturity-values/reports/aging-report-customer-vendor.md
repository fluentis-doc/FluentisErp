title: Vendor/Customer Aging Report
---


From this form, it is possible to initiate the printing of the Aging Report.

This particular printout is designed to provide, at a glance, a situation for both suppliers and customers regarding the composition of overdue and upcoming accounts by temporal categories.

For example: it is possible to select one category at a time, focusing for instance on customers (and possibly selecting only Italian customers) to obtain a view of the overdue amounts divided into brackets of 0 to 30 days, 30 to 60 days, and over 60 days. The same applies for upcoming accounts, achieving a division into three brackets to evaluate the amounts with the shortest due dates compared to those further away in time.

The printout features a legend at the top for understanding the total overdue and upcoming amounts (TOT = A + B + C...).

The division brackets for the accounts can be freely set by the user in terms of the number of days.

The Days section is, in fact, the specific element of the form for this printout, and allows the entry of the number of days, with a negative sign (mandatory) for overdue amounts and positive for upcoming accounts to determine the size of the grouping brackets.

The reading in the printout will be from left (overdue) to right (upcoming), and therefore it is recommended to adhere to the logic of the fields that are numbered from 1 (which will be the leftmost and therefore the most "aged" overdue amount) to 6 (the upcoming amount that is furthest away in time) where field 1 will have a larger negative number that will reduce down to 2 and 3 until it returns to zero and grows positively.

The **other fields of the form** are the same as those used in other prints of the module. **[See here for more details](/docs/finance-area/maturity-values/reports/customer-vendor-due-register)**
