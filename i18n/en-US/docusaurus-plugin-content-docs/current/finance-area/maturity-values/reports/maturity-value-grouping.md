The print that is launched from this form should be used instead of the other prints of the module, such as Maturity Values List, Account Statement on Open Maturity Values, and Client/Vendor Due Resgister, when there are grouped mat. values.

Managing mat. values through groupings represents indeed an alternative and particular methodology compared to the classic approach and requires specific visualization to obtain a clearly readable situation.

For further **[details on mat. values grouping, see here.](/docs/finance-area/ledger-records/records/create-ledger-record/mat-val-grouping-tab)**

The print corresponds to the function of **[screen visualization of groups matches.](/docs/finance-area/maturity-values/maturity-values/maturity-value-grouping)**

The filter fields of the form mirror those provided for launching the **[other prints of the module referred to](/docs/finance-area/maturity-values/reports/customer-vendor-due-register).**

**SPECIFIC ELEMENTS:**

**Group Type**: Open/Closed = Although the individual mat. values of the group may be open or closed by payments of opposite sign, the entire group is considered closed when all mat. values are closed and the total debits and credits of the group balance. Therefore, it is possible to select this condition in the filter.

**Info do not visualize**: It is possible to exclude from the print the data referring to the selected types (which refer to the account types linked to the registrers).
