In the 'Economic operations' tab, it is possible to record the management costs of the asset that do not go in the asset book (e.g., fuel cards of a car, regular maintenance of systems, etc.): it is usually not used, also because it would require a specific ledger template for the movement and would complicate the bookkeeping somewhat.

See also the corresponding article in the **[Ledger Records](/docs/finance-area/ledger-records/records/ledger-record)** section.
