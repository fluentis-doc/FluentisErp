In the 'Economic operations' tab, it is possible to record the management costs of the asset that do not go in the asset book (e.g., fuel cards of a car, regular maintenance of systems, etc.): it is usually not used, also because it would require a specific accounting reason for the movement and would complicate the bookkeeping somewhat.
