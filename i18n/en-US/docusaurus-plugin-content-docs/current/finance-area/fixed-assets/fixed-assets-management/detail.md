Let us to see the 'Detail' section: the fixed asset status is managed automatically by the ERP according to the operations linked to the fixed asset and this procedure has not to be forced. The activity start date, proposed as current date, corresponds to the date on which the fixed asset is entered in the company: only starting from this date it will be possible to amortize it. The activity end date usually is not set, except in special cases, in order to block the depreciation calculation and not to view the fixed asset more: on the normal management, to the completion of the residual depreciation, the fixed asset will not be amortized more. The following dates related to the guarantees have not a specific management: it regards available fields in oder to record these elements.

On **Fixed Asset** field it is possible to record automatically the patrimonial detail account for the selected fixed asset category; the following code of vendor is not managed automatically by the program, because reference vendors and customers of the various operations will be indicated specifically within these ones. The cost detail account references to the detail of cost chart of accounts, usually not used.

**Location and matrix** are free textual fields where it is possible to note location and matrix of the fixed asset; the employee code enables the user to record the subject that is using the fixed asset.

According to the parameters settings, it is possible to view a civil depreciation percentage 'personalized' for the single fixed asset, to be used in priority to the one of the belonging category and also the unit of measure for quantities valorized in the fixed asset card.

On **deductibility** field it is possible to associate the single fixed asset on its fiscal deductibility priority type of its depreciations.

The **cost centres/sales job orders** section can be activated only after having saved the fixed asset register: it enables the user to attribute a percentage structure of automatic valorization of depreciations to the various cost centres/sales job order set in the company.

Then there is a series of check boxes: default of fixed asset **in use** (if there is not the flag, the fixed asset will not be amortized), fixed asset status **used** (if flag is set, the anticipated depreciation will be applied only on the first purchase and the **first year depreciation** flag will not have effect, for this reason on the first year the application percentages of depreciations will not be reduced); 

**in maintenance** means that the fixed asset is to be recorded in maintenances report; 

**Loaned** is an active flag only for immaterial fixed asset categories and it is necessary to exclude the report to fixed assets journal in case that patrimonial value has been eliminated from the budget (direct depreciation in account and not to fund); 

**Total Depreciation** enables the user to attribute the 100% depreciation to the fixed asset directly to the first year: during the saving of fixed asset, the ERP will verify the correctness of this setting in respect to the limit set on the fixed asset category; it is possible to view the printed or not fixed asset status, that indicates that the header references of fixed asset cannot be edited in case that this has already been inserted in a definitive report of depreciable fixed asset journal. 

In conclusion, the **system for assessing income** and **sector studies** in order to identify the fixed assets to be considered for these tax compliances.
