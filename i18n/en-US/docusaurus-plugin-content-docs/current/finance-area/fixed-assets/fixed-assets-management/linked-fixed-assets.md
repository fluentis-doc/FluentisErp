In the 'Linked fixed assets (Cespiti collegati)' tab, it is possible to view and add child asset records of the asset in use: this option does not create any automation regarding the sale of assets or grouping of records in printing (they remain separate records). The linkage does, however, influence the calculation of depreciation: the child asset will be depreciated based on the start date of the parent asset's activity.
