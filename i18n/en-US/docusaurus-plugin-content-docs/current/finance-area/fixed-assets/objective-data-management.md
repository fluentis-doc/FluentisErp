If the fixed asset category shows the management of 'Objective Depreciations', there will be also the management tab: on this one, the upper grid will present the list of patrimonial operations that are in the fixed asset, taken by the grid and that can be edited partially in this section (cancellations and new lines independent from the official ones are allowed). On the contrary, the grid below will contain the objective calculations of depreciations, according to the fixed asset percentage or objective depreciation type inserted into the same fixed asset header.

RIBBON BAR: it represents the Form menu, that is the area in which it is possible to perform actions linked to the fixed asset in management. The list of features Â is the following:



| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| New Operation | It activates the cursor for the insertion of a new objective operation line. |
| Delete Operation | It deletes the objective operation selected in the grid. |
| Execute Objective Depreciation | It calculates the objective depreciation for year set in the field above the depreciations grid. |
