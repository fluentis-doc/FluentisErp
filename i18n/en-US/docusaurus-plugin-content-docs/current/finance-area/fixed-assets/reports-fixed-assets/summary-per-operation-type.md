From this form, it is possible to extract the various types of operations related to the selected assets in the grid.

The form consists of three parts: 

- the filter area at the top (**[for details see here](/docs/finance-area/fixed-assets/reports-fixed-assets/yearly-fixed-assets-purchase)**); 

- the asset category grid that allows, upon activation of the **Fixed Asset Category** flag, to select the desired category (or categories by pressing the Ctrl key). If the flag is not active, data will be extracted for all categories;

- the grid on the right allows selecting the desired type (or types by pressing the Ctrl key). With the **All the operations** flag active, all types will be considered.
