It is possible to change the priority by selecting the criterion and using the commands located in the ribbon bar. ![](/img/it-it/finance-area/fixed-assets/reports-fixed-assets/fixed-assets-sheets/image03.png)

The reading priority of the criteria goes from top to bottom.

(In the image, the sorting will occur first by category, then by type of property if the category is the same, then by pre-code and number, etc.)

 

The flag **Fiscal data** makes additional columns appear containing data related to tax depreciation.

The other filtering fields are the usual ones already dealt with for other prints and forms in the asset area.
