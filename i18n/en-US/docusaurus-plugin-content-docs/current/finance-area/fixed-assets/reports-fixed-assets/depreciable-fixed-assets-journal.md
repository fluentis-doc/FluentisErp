The report mask of fixed assets journal enables the user to set the search filters during data extraction.

In particular it is important to notice that: usually the sold or destroyed fixed assets of the previous years compared to the reference year inserted will not be reported in report, whether not imposing the specific flag. At the same time it will be possible to exclude from report the fixed assets that have activity end date in register.

The definitive report flag will block header data of the various printed fixed assets registers, will block even the cancellation of the single printed line and will update the counter of pages for the reference year within financial accounting parameters. The cancellation of the definitive report can be performed by the enabled user from the “Financial Accounting Parameters” mask.

It is important to notice some standard reports that can be linked to this procedure: report of “fiscal” fixed assets journal (to be used for customers who use the fiscal calculation) and report of fixed assets journal with initial values (that does not report all the historical detail of every fixed asset but a single initial summary line of start data of the required year and in addition the related detail).
