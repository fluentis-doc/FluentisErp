On fixed assets management mask the first field corresponds to the setting related to the original fixed asset category, in order to establish that the fixed asset belongs to the company as proposed automatically: there are also fixed assets in leasing and hire, that are numbered separately by others and do not finish on reports of depreciable fixed assets journal. This management enables the user to simulate the depreciations calculation of the end of the year for comparing to leasing paid at the end of the tax calculation. In case of not property fixed asset it will be possible to insert some reference notes to the related contract.

Subsequently, it is possible to attribute a pre-code to the fixed asset numbering (attributed at the moment of saving): if it is not inserted, the automatic numbering proposed on the following field will be the only one on all fixed assets of active company/department, while it could refer to a particular pre-code that usually refers to the category code of belonging fixed asset. After the fixed asset number there is the fixed asset description that will be viewed and reported on the various module reports and procedures. The department field can be set at the moment of the insertion of the new fixed asset, considering that then it cannot be edited.

According to the settings of fixed assets category and module parameters it is possible to view also the objective depreciation type assigned to the fixed asset, together with a specific percentage to be used for the same fixed asset rather than the type standard.
