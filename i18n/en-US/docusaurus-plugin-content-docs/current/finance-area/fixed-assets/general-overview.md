The **Fixed Assets** module allows the operator to manage the assets for multi-year use present in the company.  
The module is located in the *Finance Area* and is updated in purchase/sale from general accounting entries based on specific reasons that foresee its movement, but the records of this module can also be introduced and aligned manually. From this module, calculations of civil/fiscal depreciation as well as multi-year simulations and tax prints are performed.  
Before proceeding with the introduction or creation of a fixed asset, it is necessary to ensure that all tabular data, as well as the parameters of the module, are correctly set.
