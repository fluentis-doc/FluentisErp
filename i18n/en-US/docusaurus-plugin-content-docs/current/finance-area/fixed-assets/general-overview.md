The fixed assets module enables the operator to manage goods for multiyear usage that are within the company. The fixed assets module is located within the finance area and it is updated during the purchase/sales financial ledger records based on specific templates that provide for its movement, but registers of this module can be introduced and aligned even manually. Through this module it is possible to calculate the various depreciations as well as multiyear simulations and tax reports. Before going on to introduce or to realize a fixed asset, it is necessary to have correctly set all table data as well as module parameters.
