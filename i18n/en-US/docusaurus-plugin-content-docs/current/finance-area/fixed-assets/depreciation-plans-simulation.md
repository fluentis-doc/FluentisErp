title: Depreciation Plans Simulation
sidebar_position: 3
---

Every simulation is linked to the user that has calculated it: at the opening of the mask there will be the button to view the last calculation performed by the user (this elaboration can be quite demanding in terms of time and elaboration resources).

The maximum years range provided for the simulation corresponds to 10 years. The following flags enable the user to set which types of property (property, leasing, hire) have to be considered in the simulation.

In the grid below it will be possible to indicate different depreciation plans to be calculated: for this reason it will be possible to calculate for each of them which depreciation types have to be simulated, together with fiscal option or not. The “calculate” flag identifies which plans will go on to simulate.

Once having saved the settings it will be possible to calculate through the specific button: at the end of the elaboration it will be viewed a summary mask of totals of category for each year/plan or for each plan/year. It is possible to change the visualization between both one and the other criterion thanks to the specific button. Starting from this mask there is an excel export.

RIBBON BAR: the ribbon bar represents the Form menu, that is the area on which it is possible to perform actions linked to the procedure in use. The possible features list is the following:



| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Save | It saves the calculation settings for the active user. |
| View the last Calculation | It views the result of the last calculation performed. |
| Calculate | It performs the calculation according to settings saved. |
