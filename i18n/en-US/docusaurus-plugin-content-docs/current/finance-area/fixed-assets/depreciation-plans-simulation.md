Each simulation is linked to the user who calculated it: upon opening the form, the button to view the last calculation made by the user will be available (this processing can be quite demanding in terms of time and processing resources).

The maximum range of years allowed for the simulation is a span of 10 years. The subsequent flags allow you to define which types of properties (property, leasing, rental) should be considered in the simulation.

In the list below, you will indicate the different amortization plans to be calculated: for each, it will be possible to define which types of amortization should be simulated, including the option for tax or not. The Calculate flag identifies for which plans the simulation will proceed.

Once the settings are saved, the calculation will proceed with the appropriate button: at the end of the process, a summary mask of the totals by category for each year/plan or by plan/year will be displayed. You can switch the view between one criterion and the other with the appropriate button. From this mask, an Excel export is provided.
