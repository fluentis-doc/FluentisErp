The fixed asset depreciation procedure allows the calculation of annual depreciations for the displayed and selected lines, according to the percentages and standard types provided in the asset categories.

It is the recommended standard procedure as it allows for bulk operations on assets (without processing the maneuver for each individual asset) and to carry out a restoration of the calculation if necessary.

Once the calculation has been processed, it will be possible to proceed to the **[Accounting](/docs/finance-area/fixed-assets/accounting/depreciation)**, which is also of bulk type.
