First of all, it is very important to manage the 'incremental operations' flag: considering that the depreciation procedure is managed according to different logics, if the company uses the incremental option for its categories it will be necessary to import this flag in order to identify data. On the contrary, Â at the base of the mask, it is necessary to set the reference calculation year: usually it will be edited in order to insert year previous than the current one. The calculation of depreciations of X year will not be allowed when depreciations of X-1 year have not been accounted.

 Once having performed the data search, it is possible, line by line, to force the number of application days as well as the depreciation percentage: it is recommended to calculate these particular cases directly within the single fixed asset tab or to edit directly table of fixed assets categories in order to perform a quick calculation with a total selection of lines. An alternative option to be used, if the user wants to use different percentages among fixed assets, can be the parameters definition of fixed assets module called 'Percentage on single fixed asset', which enables the user to set in header of each fixed asset a depreciation percentage to be used.
