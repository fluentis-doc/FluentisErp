First of all, it is very important to manage the “incremental operations” flag: considering that the depreciation procedure is managed according to different logics, if the company uses the incremental option for its categories it will be necessary to import this flag in order to identify data. At the base of the mask, on the contrary, it is necessary to set the reference calculation year: usually it will be edited in order to insert the year previous than the current one.

RIBBON BAR: the ribbon bar represents the Form menu, that is the area on which it is possible to perform actions linked to the procedure in use. The possible features list is the following:

| Search | It searches the list of depreciations to be calculated. |
| Depreciation | It performs the calculation for the selected lines. |
| View Fixed Asset | It views the fixed asset register whose depreciation is selected in the grid. |
