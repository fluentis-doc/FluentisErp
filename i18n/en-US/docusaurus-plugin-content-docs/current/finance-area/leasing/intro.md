The Leasing module of Fluentis ERP is specifically designed for managing leasing contracts entered for the acquisition of production factors and corporate assets.

It allows for the calculation of the leasing amortization plan simply by entering the basic data of the contract.

You can then proceed with the automatic accounting of the fees related to the various installments and any initial maximum fee.

At the end of the financial year, it is typically necessary to allocate a deferral to neutralize the distorting effect of the maximum fee on the company's profit, acting with the correct economic accrual criteria.

There is a specific procedure for this operation that calculates the amount of the deferral to be automatically accounted for, based on the exact days of competence and the related cost.
