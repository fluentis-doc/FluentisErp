From this position, it is possible to proceed with the mass accounting of all lease payments related to all leasing contracts present in the database that have not yet been accounted for.

In detail, the accounting procedure is the same as that which can be activated from within the **[leasing details](/docs/finance-area/leasing/new)** itself.
