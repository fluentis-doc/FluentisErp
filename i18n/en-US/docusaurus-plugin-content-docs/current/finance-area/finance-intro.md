## Features (Funzionalità)

The area dedicated to **administrative management (gestione amministrativa)** of **Fluentis ERP** includes the functionalities necessary for proper **maintenance of accounting records (tenuta delle scritture contabili)**, the drafting of the **Balance Sheet**, and the fulfillment of **tax obligations (fiscalità)** typically managed directly by the company.

Additionally, there are functionalities for managing **Fixed Assets**, **leasing**, and **Bank loan**, as well as the fundamental functionalities for those operating internationally, such as the automated compilation of **Intrastat** lists and other tax communications related to exchanges with foreign counterparts.

The management of accounting is integrated with the passive and active cycle, electronic invoicing, with the *Warehouse* and *Management Control (Controllo di gestione)*.

## Basic Data (Dati di Base)
:::danger[Attention (Attenzione)]
Before using the available functionalities, it is necessary to manage a series of basic data: they are divided into two macro groups, [**Tables**](/docs/configurations/tables/finance/general-overview) and [**Parameters**](/docs/configurations/parameters/finance/general-overview).

Alternatively, the **Fast Start** procedure described below is available.

By activating the Fast Start, you will only need to manage a minimum set of data such as [**Registers**](/docs/erp-home/registers/registers-intro).
:::

## Fast Start Procedure (Procedura di Fast Start)

:::important[**Fast Start**]
The main feature of the administrative area is its *Compliance* with accounting and tax regulations and the possibility to initialize a [**Fast Start environment (ambiente *FastStart* totalmente pronto all'uso)**](/docs/guide/fast-start) that is fully configured to meet the regulations and allow immediate use.

The user can still configure the accounting schemes, VAT codes, registers, etc. at any time as they wish.
:::


## Data Entry Flow (Flusso di inserimento dei dati)

The flexibility of the module allows for data entry in various ways: 

- **Manually (Manualmente)**, through [**direct entry of accounting records (l'immissione diretta di scritture contabili)**](/docs/finance-area/ledger-records/records/ledger-record). This mode is generally used to enter adjustment records NOT included in the automatic procedures (Accruals and Deferrals and Amortizations) such as **allocations to risk and expense funds, credit write-downs**, etc., in addition to entries such as **employee payroll entries** etc.
 
- **Automatically (Automaticamente)** thanks to **interconnection with other modules of the management system**, such as treasury, controlling, and the active and passive cycles. Typically, **active and passive invoices, payments by bank transfer and passive Ri.Ba., collections through the issuance of active Ri.Ba. or bills, leasing fees, loan installments** are automatically recorded.

- **Launching processes and procedures (Lancio di elaborazioni e procedure)**: which read the basic data to **perform calculations and produce documents or telematic flows**, (such as the processing of a **tax return (dichiarativo fiscale)** that reads VAT data generated by accounting records) or generate additional accounting entries or, more generally, additional data (such as the procedures for calculating and storing **Adjustment Records** or **closing and reopening of accounts (chiusura e riapertura dei conti)** at the end and beginning of the year).


## Typical Workflow of the Administrative Area (Flusso di lavoro tipico area amministrativa)

Although the various modules allow flexibility and the ability to manage data in various ways, either automatically or manually, we illustrate a typical complete workflow involving the administrative area and the other areas closely connected to it.

- [**Initial Opening of Balances (Apertura iniziale dei saldi)**](/docs/finance-area/ledger-records/records/automatic-accounts-opening/new) of the budget (auxiliary wizard alternative to manual loading via accounting entry) or [import (import)](/docs/applications/bizlink/import-posting-ledgers) from another system or automatic reopening of [last year's closing (chiusura anno precedente)](/docs/finance-area/ledger-records/records/automatic-account-closing/new-account-closing)
- [Import of open items (Importazione delle partite aperte)](/docs/applications/bizlink/import-open-matutities), necessary only in the case of migration from the previous system
- [Import of fixed assets (Importazione cespiti)](/docs/applications/bizlink/import-fixed-assets), necessary only in the case of migration from the previous system. Purchases made during the year automatically load the fixed asset records through the respective accounting entries (using appropriate accounting reasons)
- **Ledger Records** (automatic procedure) of the [**Active**](/docs/sales/sales-invoices/accounting/sales-invoices-accounting) and **Passive** cycle (also from received [electronic invoices (fatture elettroniche)](/docs/finance-area/sdi-documents/incoming-purchase-documents#contabilizzazione-automatica))
- Management of [**Open maturity values**](/docs/finance-area/maturity-values/intro), automatic, linked to the creation of accounting movements for both invoicing and collection and payment
- Accounting of **Income** and **Payments** (automatic procedure, alternatively or for some types, manual entries may be made). For collections typically automated through the flow of [**Cash order**](/docs/treasury/bills-holding/accounting/bills-accounting). For payments typically automated through the flow of [**Bank Transfers (Bonifici)**](/docs/treasury/vendors-payments/accounting/vendor-payments-accounting). Procedures located in [**the treasury area (area tesoreria)**](/docs/treasury/treasury-intro)
- Current accounting prints of [account statements (estratti conto)](/docs/finance-area/ledger-records/accounting-report/account-statement) (*mastrini*), [trial balances (bilanci di verifica)](/docs/finance-area/ledger-records/accounting-report/trial-balance), [annual accounts (d'esercizio)](/docs/finance-area/ledger-records/fiscal-report/period-balance-sheet), and [account journals (giornale contabile)](/docs/finance-area/ledger-records/fiscal-report/journal).
- Prints of [ledgers (partitari)](/docs/finance-area/maturity-values/reports/account-statement-on-open-maturity-values) for customers-suppliers such as [due registers (scadenzari)](/docs/finance-area/maturity-values/reports/customer-vendor-due-register), etc.
- [**Settlement**](/docs/finance-area/ledger-records/fiscal-report/period-vat-settlement) of the **VAT**.
- Other periodic [**tax obligations (adempimenti)**](/docs/finance-area/declarations/intro)
- Management of receiving the [invoices (parcelle)](/docs/finance-area/professional-men/general-overview) from professionals and [Sales Agents (Agenti)](/docs/sales/agents/procedures/create-professional-man-commission) (functionality located in the Sales area) and the [annual withholding tax certification (certificazione unica)](/docs/finance-area/declarations/declarations/withholding-tax-certification) for withholding tax
- Optional processing through the functions of the [Controlling area (area Controlling)](/docs/controlling/mid-year-closures/general-overview) for detailed periodic accounting situations. The period subject to the situation can be freely chosen, and some automatic procedures can be associated to generate, proportionally to the period under analysis, accounting adjustments (accruals and deferrals for the period), fixed asset depreciations (for the period), final inventories, and invoices to be issued and received.
- [**Adjustment Records**](/docs/finance-area/ledger-records/records/adjustment-record/adjustment-creation) (accruals and deferrals and invoices to be received) automatic calculation procedure (reading the economic competence dates in the entered accounting movements) and accounting; other adjustment entries manually inserted such as write-downs, provisions, etc.
- Calculation and accounting of [**Depreciations**](/docs/finance-area/fixed-assets/accounting/depreciations-accounting): automatic with the specific procedure
- Final inventory allocation: manual entry to be inserted that can refer to logistical area procedures for calculating [valued inventories (giacenze valorizzate)](/docs/logistics/physical-inventory/inventory-reports/valorized-inventory-with-quantity).
- [**Closing of Accounts (Chiusura dei conti)**](/docs/finance-area/ledger-records/records/automatic-account-closing/new-account-closing): automatic procedure with the possibility of automatic reopening in the following year, reopening of adjustment entries, automatic journal entries to accommodate the loss for the year.
