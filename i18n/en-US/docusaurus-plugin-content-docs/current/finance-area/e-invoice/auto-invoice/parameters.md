title: Accounting Parameters for Selfbilling
sidebar_position: 1

:::note NOTE:
The following instructions refer to the procedure for the automated generation of selfbillings for sales created in order to communicate to the ES, through the electronic invoicing circuit, the data on purchases previously communicated through the repealed obligation known as "Esterometro".
:::

It is necessary to indicate some default elements for the creation of the selfbilling document in sales:

1) the unit of measure to be used in the non-coded item that will be inserted into the document

2) the corresponding sales turnover for potential accounting

3) the detail account of the customer of the selfbilling, that is, the customer that identifies the company itself

The accounting of the selfbilling is not mandatory, as it is usually complemented by a direct automatic entry linked to the supplier invoice: it is therefore generally possible to indicate one of the already existing sales turnovers, without the need to define a specific one.
