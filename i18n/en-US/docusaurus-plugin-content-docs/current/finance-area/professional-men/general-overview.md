The Fluentis ERP Professional Men module manages activities related to payments made to external professionals and agents, ensuring control over withholding tax and related tax obligations, such as the completion of the F24 form. This module allows for the registration of commissions, accounting for payments, and generating tax certifications. The module can receive agent data from the corresponding module in the **Sales** area.  
From this module, debt for various taxes to be paid (Withholding, Insurance fund, Social security) is recorded.

**Main Features**

- Search and management of commissions: Allows you to enter, modify, and view commissions, with the option to delete incorrect entries and manage withholding payments en masse, avoiding manual modifications on individual commissions.

- Commissions Accounting: commissions can be accounted for directly, both for the tax side (Withholdings, Social security, Insurance fund) and for managing company cost and profit centers. Definitive commissions is then entered into accounting.

- F24 Form: The module manages the calculation and completion of the F24 form for the payment of withholdings and other taxes, with the possibility of automatically proposing the necessary data based on the information entered in the commissions.



**Available Prints**

- Withholding certificate printout: Generates the certification of periodic withholdings in advance.

- Withholding situation: Provides a summary of withholdings paid or to be paid, useful for internal control and the compilation of the Unique Certification.

- Commission printout: Supports the management of commissions earned by agents, with filters for date and agent, allowing for the processing of complete lists.



**Main Procedures**

- Management of commissions and withholding payments: Allows loading, modifying, and linking tax documents related to commissions, and manually or massively managing payment data.

- Commission calculation: Automates the calculation of commissions for agents, with the ability to link compensations to specific projects or engagements.


**Advantages of using the module**: This module interacts with the **Sales** module for reading calculated agent commissions and transforming them into the agent's Invoice, ensuring the calculation of both withholding tax and Enasarco pension contributions, and also with the Tax Declarations module allowing for complete management of taxation, up to the CU (unique certification of withholding tax) independently without necessarily resorting to external consulting. The processing of the Currency convert also allows exporting the electronic track for submission to the Revenue Agency. Special attention has been given to the logic of managing compensation and the Italian reality, with the ability to enter a pre-invoice notice (essentially a proforma invoice) and proceed to payment, thereby creating the debt for tax payments before accounting for the received invoice.
