In this form, it is possible to filter the payments made in the month in order to assign, in bulk, to the selected ones the references of the payment with model F24, without having to enter each payment to insert them one by one. Once the payments are filtered and selected, the data is set in the 'payment' section, and then assigned with the 'Set Payment' button.
