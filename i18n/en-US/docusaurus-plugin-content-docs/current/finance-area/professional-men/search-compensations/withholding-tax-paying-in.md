In the current mask it is possible to filter payments, performed month by month, in order to assign them the references of the paying-in through a F24 italian model, without entering into each compensation with the task to insert them one to one. Once having filtered and selected compensations, it is necessary to set data in the 'paying-in' section and then to assign them thanks to the use of 'Set paying-in' button.
