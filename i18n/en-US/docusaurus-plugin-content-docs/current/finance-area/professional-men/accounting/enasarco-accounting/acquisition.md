Once the registration dates, competence dates, the ledger reccords template to be used, and any management in a single registration (without any grouping in case of equal detail accounts) are set at the bottom of the form, it will be sufficient to press the accounting button: if everything goes well, the selected lines will disappear from the grid, and from the rollback tab, it will be possible to preview the result.
