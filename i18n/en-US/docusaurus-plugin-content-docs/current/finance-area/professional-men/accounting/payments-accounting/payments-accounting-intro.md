With this procedure, it is possible to carry out the accounting of payments for the compensations received entered into the system.

The payment accounting can occur both on the pro forma invoice (without document number and date) and on the final invoice.

Therefore, the order in which this procedure can be carried out concerning **[Commissions Accounting](/docs/finance-area/professional-men/accounting/compensation-accounting/compensations-accounting)** will depend on whether an invoice or a pro forma notice is issued directly by the professional man. This possibility is also linked to the fact that the term for the payment of the withholding tax starts from the moment of payment and not from the invoicing.

**For the correct management of the withholding tax by Fluentis, it is recommended to manage the payment of professional man exclusively through this procedure, avoiding manual entries in the journal or operating from the Treasury module.**
