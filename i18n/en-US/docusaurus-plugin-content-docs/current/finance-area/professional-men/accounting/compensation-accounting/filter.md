The upper part of the mask is dedicated to setting search filters. Once the registration dates for proficiency and any provisional status registration are set at the bottom of the mask, it is sufficient to press the accounting button: if everything goes well, the selected lines will disappear from the grid, and the rollback form will allow you to preview the result.
