With this procedure, the compensation amounts that have become definitive are recorded in the general ledger and in the VAT register.

To proceed with the operation, it is **mandatory that the compensation has the number and the date of the definitive document** (even if the template connected to the type of withholding is a non-VAT template), as well as **at least one deadline** to be recorded.

If the definitive references are missing, it is possible to edit the compensation directly from this screen, through the corresponding button ![](/img/it-it/finance-area/professional-men/accounting/compensation-accounting/compensations-accounting/image01.png).
