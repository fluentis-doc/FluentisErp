Through this procedure it will be possible to move definitive compensations to the financial accounting in order to record invoice into the VAT register. Then in order to go on to the operation it is necessary that the compensation has definitive document number and date (even if the template linked to the withholding-tax type corresponds to a not VAT template) as well as a maturity. If the definitive references miss, it is possible to edit the compensation directly starting from this mask and through the related management button.
