With this printout, it is possible to extract data regarding the payments made for compensation, in order to have a summary of the data related to the withholding taxes operated for the purpose of managing the payment with model F24 or for performing verifications in the context of the unique certification of the recipients and the subsequent model 770.

There are two different layouts of the printout selectable via the combo box in the top left: the first, "Withholding Tax Certification," reflects the free-form communication that was sent to the recipients until the recent introduction of the Unique Certification, while the second, "Withholding Tax Situation," presents itself as a verification list.
