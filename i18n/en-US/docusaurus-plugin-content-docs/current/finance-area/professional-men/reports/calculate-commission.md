The report available in this position (related to the administrative area) has been created to support **[calculate commissions](/docs/finance-area/professional-men/procedures/calculate-commissions)** present in the administrative procedures (which draws data from the agent commissions entered directly by the accounting entries, following appropriate configuration of the involved accounting causes).

Through this report, it is possible to process the list of accrued commissions, optionally filtering by individual agent, by customer, by date, and entering the reference date to consider the commission accrued.
