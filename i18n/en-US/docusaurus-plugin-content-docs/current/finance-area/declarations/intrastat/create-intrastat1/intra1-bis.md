The 'bis' section of the Intrastat declarations contains detailed data for the period related to the transfer of goods.

This section is filled in automatically by the procedure, but manual modification and supplementation are allowed.

In the ribbon bar, there is a button to group the lines based on the counterparty's data, with the same combined nomenclature and nature of the transaction, as well as code, transportation mode, destination country, and origin province (the last two are generally homogeneous in relation to the same counterparty).
