The 'quinquies' section of the Intrastat declarations contains corrections related to declarations from previous periods concerning the provision of services. This section is automatically populated by the procedure, bringing data from invoice types with transaction nature 'S â€“ services', or from accounting records (not generated from purchases/sales) that always have lines of type 'VAT Service', but modification and manual integration are allowed.
