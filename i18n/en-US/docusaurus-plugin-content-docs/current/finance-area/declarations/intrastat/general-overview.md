The Intrastat module is dedicated to the creation of Intrastat statistical declarations: it is planed both a manual data management and an automatic insertion as regards data within purchase and sales invoices related to sales and purchase areas, as well as a data retrieve of services from the ledger records. The module is located within the Finance Area on Declarations Module.

The basic settings are linked to register and to sales and purchase document types: for this reason it is necessary that document corresponds to the intra-Community type and that its register has been set as intrastat subject. In order to get the maximum of automatisms it will be necessary to set, in the items registers, the nomenclature codes of each of them as well as the possible conversion factors for obtaining also the automatic valorization of the additional unit of measure. Obviously it is necessary to set data of transport type and delivery conditions within the various documents completely.

The use of this module can be performed through the creation of a new intrastat1 declaration (for sales) and intrastat2 (for purchase): in this way there will be the possibility to complete data by taking them from purchase and sales invoices thanks also to the automatic procedure or from ledger records for services to be reported in quater/quinquies sections, or through the manual insertion in the related sections.

Once having completed data of models it will be possible to go on to print models or to send the same ones electronically with file creation.
