Through this form, it is possible to search for and access ALL processed Intrastat models, including both INTRA 1 (sales) and INTRA 2 (purchases).

NOTE: in the search grid, the flag in the Intrastat column is only informational to distinguish INTRA 1 (flag NOT active) from INTRA 2 (flag active).

In the filter settings in the header of the form, you can select only INTRA 1 or INTRA 2 for a targeted search.

Alternatively, there are two corresponding forms called **[INTRASTAT 1](/docs/finance-area/declarations/intrastat/search-intrastat/intrastat1)** and **[INTRASTAT 2](/docs/finance-area/declarations/intrastat/search-intrastat/intrastat2)** that perform the same function but are reserved for searching only the corresponding models.
