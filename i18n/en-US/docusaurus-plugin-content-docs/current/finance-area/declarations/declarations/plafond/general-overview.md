The procedure allows the operator to manage VAT Ceiling calculations, both as a fixed and mobile ceiling. It is present in the finance area, within the general ledger module, and receives data from ledger records.

It is important to remember that:

To avoid financially penalizing taxpayers who make exports and intra-community sales with a significant impact relative to their turnover, thus preventing the formation of excessive VAT credits, the legislator has provided for these subjects the ability to purchase goods and/or services (excluding real estate and building plots and goods/services with non-deductible VAT) without the application of the tax.

The **Plafond** represents the amount within which habitual exporters, that is, those who in the reference period (previous calendar year or last 12 months) have recorded exports, intra-community sales, and other similar operations (therefore non-taxable) **exceeding 10% of the turnover,** can make purchases suspended from tax, thus not applying VAT.

The habitual exporter can determine the ceiling available using **two different methodologies**: the **fixed ceiling** or the **Plafond mobile**.

The **fixed ceiling** method involves taking as the **calculation base** the non-taxable operations related to exports and similar operations** recorded in the previous calendar year.** As of January 1 of each year, the available ceiling consists of the non-taxable operations recorded in the previous year, and then, during the year of use, it is sufficient to ensure that purchases and imports with a declaration of intent do not exceed the amount of the available ceiling.

The **mobile plafond** is calculated instead by considering the **operations recorded in the twelve months preceding.**

With the mobile plafond method, **the amount of the ceiling** available is given by the **difference between the non-taxable operations recorded in the 12 months preceding** and the corresponding cumulative usage. In the month when the first facilitated purchases occur, **the cumulative usage is given by the difference between the purchases in suspension made in the month and the non-taxable operations related to the 13th month previous.**
