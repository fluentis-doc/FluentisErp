The first operation to be performed at the beginning of activities with program consists on loading the historical values to be used. By generating a new Plafond it is possible to open a window on which it is necessary to insert the following values: Plafond description, if this corresponds to a new Plafond or if it is an extension (mobile plafond), if it is Solar (fix) or Mobile (that are two fix fiscal options provided for plafond management). Then it is necessary to insert month and start year of plafond, and in case of an “extension” plafond it is necessary to insert also month, year and amount of the last period calculated. Lastly, it is possible to set a threshold value starting from which to advice user that the available plafond is going to be used totally.

At this point the user can view the grid below, where it is possible to display data belonging to the previous twelve months: in case of a mobile plafond, it will be necessary to insert detail, month by month, because as regards each month it will be necessary to cut the 12°month and to add data belonging to the new 12° month; on the contrary, in case of solar plafond, it is possible to load the first 11 months with all zero values and to give total sales in plafond of year in the final December period directly. Once having clicked the button with the arrow towards right, the program will control data completeness and save plafond, in order to use it.

RIBBON BAR: the ribbon bar represents the Form menu, that is the area on which it is possible to perform actions about a pre-existing document, rather than to create a new one. The possible features list is the following:



| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Save | It saves plafond data |
| Go to Plafond | It saves the plafond and makes it definitive for the use |
