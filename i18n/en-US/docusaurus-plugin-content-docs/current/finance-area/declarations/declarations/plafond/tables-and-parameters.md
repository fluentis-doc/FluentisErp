The basic setting of plafond comes exclusively from “VAT Rate Mode” table : the use of a Plafond VAT Rate in a Purchase record will use the existing plafond, while its insertion on Sales will increment the available value for the following period (regardless of the accounting template and record register). The credit notes, obviously, transfer the related amounts from movements.
