## Tables and Preliminary Parameters for Ceiling Management

The setup for the ceiling calculation derives solely from the table [**VAT Rate Modifications (Aliquote modalit√† IVA)**](/docs/configurations/tables/finance/vat-rates): 

The fields of the table involved are:

**Ceiling (Plafond):** the flag defines which rates are linked to the declarations of intent: this flag identifies the rate that "**consumes**" the general available ceiling month by month as habitual exporters.

**Foreign Sales for Ceiling (Vendita Estera per Plafond):** this flag identifies the VAT rates present in sales records for the year yyyy, which **increase** the available ceiling for year yyyy+1 as habitual exporters.

The accounting reason and the registrant's record do not matter. Credit notes adjust the amounts related to the movements.
