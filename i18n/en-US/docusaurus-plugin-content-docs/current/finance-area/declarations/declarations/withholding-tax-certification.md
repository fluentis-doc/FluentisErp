title: Online Withholding Certification 
sidebar_position: 2
---

From this form, it is possible to manage the Unique Certification of withholding taxes applied to recipients by generating the file for online submission.

:::danger **WARNING**:
 For correct data processing by the application, it is essential that both the payments to the recipients, **and the related payment**, have been registered using the functionalities of the recipient module, so that the withholding tax liability can be calculated correctly.
:::

The structure of the form, slightly different from the rest of the application, allows for the display of existing communications and their related details all in one screen.

The **Search** button, present in the ribbon bar, allows you to search for communications already entered, which will be displayed in the upper grid Results.

By selecting a communication, a preview of the corresponding detail will be visible in the central Details grid (without the need to enter edit mode).

Double-clicking on the declaration allows you to enter edit mode for it.

The **New** button will create a new declaration.

### REGISTERS MANAGEMENT:

Within the section related to contact information, there are (open the expander) fields for the recipient's data (date and place of birth). This information will be included in the unique certification. The two fields for **Name** and **Surname** must also be filled out as the single field Company Name does not suffice for tax purposes.

### HEADER DATA ENTRY:

**Year**: automatically proposed to be equal to the current year;

**NINO Sub. Oblig.**: enter the tax code of the company (withholding agent). This data will be reported in the online trace and on the header of the printed tax model.

**NINO Intermediary**: if using an authorized intermediary to send the declaration (Caf, Accountant, etc.), indicate the related tax code here.

**Caf Registration Number**: this field allows you to enter the registration number of the intermediary authorized to submit online;

**Dispatch use date**: field to indicate the date of the commitment for electronic submission by the authorized intermediary;

**File name**: it is necessary to specify the name of the electronic file that will be generated;

**File path**: a local path must be specified for saving the file for online submission; the document will also be stored in the document management of Fluentis and accessible from the commenting form via the button ![](/img/neutral/common/document-manager.png);

**Type sending**: specify in this field, via the combo box, whether it is an ordinary submission or a substitute or cancellation (see ministerial instructions). This field must be managed in conjunction with the flags **Cancellation** and **Substitution**, which update their respective fields within the tax model.

**Aggregate / Detailed**: this field specifies whether the unique certification to be processed will be detailed (will report the distinct data for each single payment made to each recipient) or aggregated (will report the consolidated and totalized data for each single recipient). See ministerial instructions.

**Subject Making the Declaration, Individual**: the combo box, linked to the Employee table, allows you to insert the subject who signs the declaration (this data is mandatory).

**Position code**: enter via the combo box the charge code of the subject who signs the declaration (e.g., legal representative), see ministerial instructions;

**Subject Making the Declaration, Legal Entity**: in this field, you can enter the personal data (taken from the registries already present in the system) of a company that submits the declaration on behalf of the operating company (see ministerial instructions);

**Date signature withholding**: it is necessary to indicate the date of the signature of the declaration;

**Signature**: always activate the flag indicating that the declaration is signed and prints the name of the signing subject (see field Subject Making the Declaration...).

### DETAILS GRID 

The fields reflect the data present in the ministerial model, and therefore, for content illustration, reference is made to fiscal instructions.

It is possible to intervene manually by modifying the data that are automatically generated by the calculation process, which can be activated from the ribbon bar.![](/img/it-it/finance-area/declarations/declarations/withholding-tax-certification/image03.png)

To generate the file to be transmitted electronically, use the **Export** button. The file will be stored in Fluentis's document management and a copy can be downloaded to your local PC.
