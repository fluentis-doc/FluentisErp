title: Vat settlement of Group

From this form, it is possible to calculate special VAT settlements related to the GROUP VAT status (both when the company in use is the parent company and when it is part of the group, thus the balance of its settlement is transferred to the parent company).

Pressing the NEW button allows you to enter a new settlement. In the header, you enter the year and calculation period.

The calculation will acquire and aggregate all results from the companies adhering to the group ("controlled companies") which must be entered in the grid and will total them on the parent company.

At this point, executing the VAT return (LIPE) with the appropriate flag activated for the VAT group will not display the results of the VAT total credits and debits (which continue to be referred to the individual companies), but the totals of VAT to be paid or credits transferred and aggregated on the parent company.
