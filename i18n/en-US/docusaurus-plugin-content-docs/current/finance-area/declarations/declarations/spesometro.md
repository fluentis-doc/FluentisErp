The "Spesometro" has been profoundly modified starting from the year 2017. From that year, quarterly submissions are required through an exchange system similar to that used for electronic invoicing for public administration.

Therefore, while the form and features are still present for backward compatibility and potential consultation, there is a new specific command called **[Spesometro 2017 quarterly invoices (Spesometro 2017 fatture trimestrali)](/docs/finance-area/declarations/declarations/spesometro-2017-quarterly).**
