**Disclaimers**: The Declarations module of Fluentis ERP supports the management of the main declarations and tax obligations required by Italian regulations, allowing companies to automate the preparation and electronic submission of tax documents.
Main Features (Funzionalità Principali)

- Electronic invoicing with non-resident parties: With the abolition of the "Esterometro" obligation that was previously managed, the automatic creation of self-invoices for the communication of purchases made from intra-community or extra-community suppliers for service purchases (as well as Italian purchases under the reverse charge regime) has been implemented.

- Unique Certification (Certificazione Unica): Manages the creation and electronic submission of the Unique Certification for withheld taxes against recipients. The procedure generates the telematic file necessary for submission to the Revenue Agency​.

- Group VAT liquidation (Liquidazione IVA di gruppo): Manages periodic VAT liquidations in VAT group contexts, aggregating data from controlled companies to calculate the VAT to be paid at the group level​.

- Communication of periodic VAT liquidations (LIPE): Allows the generation and electronic submission of summary communications of monthly or quarterly VAT liquidations​.

- Declaration of intention (Dichiarazione di intento): Manages the entry and modification of declarations of intention issued or received, with particular attention to the management of VAT groups and international billing​.

- Annual periodic VAT declaration (Dichiarazione annuale IVA periodica): Allows processing of the values of periodic VAT liquidations, generating a supporting report for the completion of tax forms​.

- Ventilation of fees (Ventilazione dei corrispettivi): Allows management of VAT ventilation based on sales movements, linking sales and purchase records to process relevant operations​.

- Management of the VAT ceiling for habitual exporters (Gestione del Plafond iva per esportatori abituali).

Available Prints (Stampe Disponibili)

- Print of Unique Certification (Stampa della Certificazione Unica): Provides a detailed summary of withholdings made on recipients, in compliance with tax regulations​.

- Print of declarations of intention (Stampa delle dichiarazioni di intento): Allows monitoring and verification of the still billable limits for declarations of intention​.

**Intrastat**: dedicated to the creation of *Intrastat* statistical communications: both manual data management and automatic creation based on the data present within purchase and sales invoices in their respective purchase and sales areas are provided, as well as a recovery of data from accounting records. The two modes are alternative and interdependent. By accounting for the affected invoices with appropriate settings, it is possible to manage automatic creation through accounting records for both goods and services.
