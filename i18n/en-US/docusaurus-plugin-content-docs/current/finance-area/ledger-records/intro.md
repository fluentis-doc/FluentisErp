The module includes functionalities for searching, entering, and modifying accounting records and related VAT movements. With this module, a complete maintenance of the company's accounting is possible.

The records are generated by the document accounting procedures of the active and passive cycles or entered directly in a manual way.

From the module, users can proceed to view the balance sheet, view the accounts, as well as launch various **Reports**, grouped into three blocks:

- **Accounting**: Balances, Account statements, accounting situations, and other detailed prints
- **Fiscal**: Accounting books, VAT registers, VAT liquidations, Declarations of intent
- **Analytic accounting**: movements of the cost centers linked to accounting movements


The **Procedures** of the module allow:

- The calculation and accounting of adjustment entries
- The automatic closing and reopening of accounts
- The calculation of year-end exchange differences (Currency regularization)
- The management of provisional records
- The reordering of VAT protocols

Before proceeding with the introduction or creation of a record, it is necessary to ensure that all tabular data as well as the [**Parameters**](/docs/configurations/parameters/finance/accounting-parameters) of the module are correctly set.

The accounting data is used by the Controlling module to process interim closures and to process all movements of the related cost centers.
The module is closely interconnected with treasury, exchanging data and receiving accounting movements from the automatic accounting procedures of various accounting events related to treasury operations (wire transfers, active portfolio, etc...)

One of the fundamental and characteristic features of the module for ledger records is its Logic based on [**Ledger Templates**](/docs/configurations/tables/finance/ledger-records-templates/ledger-records-templates-intro) freely configurable to define oneâ€™s own accounting schemes.
