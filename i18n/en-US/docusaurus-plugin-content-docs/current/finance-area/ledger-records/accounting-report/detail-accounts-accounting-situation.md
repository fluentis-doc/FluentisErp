The printout displays the debit/credit/balance of the sub-accounts.

 

It is possible, in particular, to filter the sub-accounts linked to a specific project (e.g., Job/Commessa).

**SPECIFIC REPORT OPTIONS (OPZIONI SPECIFICHE DEL REPORT)**:

**View debit/credit**: option active by default; if deactivated, the debit/credit columns will not be displayed, only the balance column will be shown.

**View balance**: option active by default; if deactivated, the balance column will no longer be visible. Note that by deactivating both this option and the previous one, the printout will effectively be unusable as it will be empty.

**View amounts in currency**: by activating this option, the sub-accounts will be grouped by currency, and totals for each group will be displayed both in currency and in Euro (or in the company’s currency in use).

**View opening values**: by activating this option, two additional columns will also be displayed showing the opening values for each individual sub-account. The values reported are those related to the procedure **[Automatic Accounts Opening](/docs/finance-area/ledger-records/records/automatic-accounts-opening/search)**.

**Print account with balance equal to zero**: option deactivated by default; therefore, sub-accounts with a zero balance will not be displayed. It can be activated to include these sub-accounts.

**Grouping criteria**:

**None**: no groupings will be executed.

**Agent**: sub-accounts related to customer registries will be grouped based on the agent linked in their respective registry. If multiple agents are present in the registry, the last one entered will be considered.

**Zone**: sub-accounts related to customer registries will be grouped based on the Zone present in the **[registry](/docs/erp-home/registers/contacts/create-new-contact/accounting-data/customer-vendors-data/delivery)**.

**Agent / Zone (Agente / Zona)**: a double grouping criterion will be active, first by agent and then, for each agent, grouped by zone.
