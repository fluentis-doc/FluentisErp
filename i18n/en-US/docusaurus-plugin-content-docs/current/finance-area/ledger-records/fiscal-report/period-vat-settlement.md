Through this print procedure, it is possible to calculate credit/debit VAT of the reference period: for this report, printing the VAT registers of the period is not mandatory but VAT settlement definitive print  of the previous period is necessary (or a manual upload in the VAT transfer that has the same result of blocking the VAT period in the accounting)  in order to report the possible credit of the previous period.

Once that the period and year of reference has been set (the period changes according to the VAT settlement frequency set in the accounting parameters. It can be one month, three months…), it is possible to decide on which settlement register it has to be printed: normally, this operation is made at the end of the selling register or on a dedicated summarizing register (suggested option). In case that the last period of the year has been selected, the user has the possibility to print/calculate VAT advanced amount. On this amount the report reports records to 12/20/yyyy. 

“View Header” flag is suggested by default: it has to be removed just in case that the company keep on printing on stamped modules. The Definitive Report option changes the period of reference to make it correspond to the one after the last definitive printed one. The number of copies to be printed is disabled. The execution of the definitive print preview does not block the period nor updates counters: only the concrete print process can block accounting period and update pages counter of the VAT registers table. (it is not important that the print process reaches a successful conclusion, it can be a print on a file)

The definitive print enables the option “accounting of the period balance”: by setting this option the application makes the list of the accounts to be used active (by taking them from accounting parameters), the user just has to give template and the dates of references: once that the print process is over, two records are added in accounting: purchasing/selling VAT giro records to debit/credit VAT detail accounts.

Finally, the option of Report-Period VAT Declaration is not important since its abolition by the Italian fiscal system.
