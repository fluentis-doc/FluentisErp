This report allows for printing DDT forms with the company header and page numbers for the year.

Please note that printing on DDT forms has been abolished for several tax registers. It is advisable to periodically check the regulations.

**Initial page**: the number is printed and refers to the first page to be printed.

**Number of pages to print (Numero pagine da stampare)**: indicates how many pages need to be printed.

**Year**: the current year is proposed by default. The year will be added to the page number, creating a string like 1/2018; 2/2018, etc....

**title**: free text that will be printed directly in the title position. It can be used to title the print in conjunction with the option that disables the header present on various reports that can be printed using DDT forms.
