title: Yearly VAT Settlement
sidebar_position: 4
---

The report features a layout similar to the **[Periodic VAT Settlement](/docs/finance-area/ledger-records/fiscal-report/period-vat-settlement)**, representing a totalization of the various months or quarters of the year to support the drafting of the annual VAT declaration (currently not managed by Fluentis).

**Accounting Year / From Registration Date / To Registration Date**: these filters related to the processing period are proposed by default with the current year and with registration dates from 1/1 to 31/12;

**From Competence Date / To Competence Date**: this filter is proposed by default as empty, and it is recommended not to filter also by competence date (accounting) for the records subject to the report, limiting it to working by registration date, so to speak, "formal";

**Yearly VAT Settlement**: flag set by default;

**Yearly VAT Communication**: not managed;

The report does NOT include a flag for the definitive version, as the settlements of the various months or quarters will be printed definitively and this report remains to support the drafting of the annual VAT declaration on the ministerial model: there is, however, a flag to store the number of the last page for those who wish to print it after the settlements of the year.
