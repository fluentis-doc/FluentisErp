Thanks to this report procedure it is possible to calculate the credit/debit VAT of the period of reference, both for ordinary system and 74 ter system.

Once that the period and the year of reference are set (the period depends on the frequency of the periodic VAT settlement set in the accounting parameters) the user can decide on which register print the settlement; normally, this operation is made at the end of the selling register or on a dedicated summary register (suggested option).

**Definitive print**: it changes the period of reference and makes it correspond to the one that just follows the last one that is definitive. The number of copies to be printed is disabled;

**Execution of definitive print preview**: it does not block the period and update counters; 

**Execution of the print process**: it can block the accounting period and update the pages counter of the VAT registers Tab. (It is not necessary that the print process reaches a good conclusion, it can be a print on a file).
