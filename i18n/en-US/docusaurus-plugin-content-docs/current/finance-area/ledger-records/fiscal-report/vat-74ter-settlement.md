With this printing procedure, the calculation of the VAT credit/debit for the reference period is performed, both for the ordinary VAT regime and for the 74-ter regime.

Once the reference period and year are set (where the period will be monthly or quarterly depending on the periodicity of the periodic VAT settlement set in the accounting parameters), it will be possible to define on which register the settlement should be printed: normally, the operation is carried out at the end of the sales register or on a dedicated summary register (recommended option).

**Definitive printed**: will modify the reference period to correspond to the one following the last one printed definitively and the number of copies to be printed will also be disabled;

**Execution of print preview (Esecuzione dell'anteprima di stampa) in definitive**: will not block the period and update the counters;

**Execution of the printing process (Esecuzione del processo di stampa)**: physically will operate the block of the period in accounting and update the page counter of the VAT Registers table (and it is not relevant whether the printing process is successful or not, it could also be a print to file).
