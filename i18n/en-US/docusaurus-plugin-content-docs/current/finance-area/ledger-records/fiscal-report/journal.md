At the opening of the window, the current accounting year and the related initial data of page number, line and  credit/debit balance  are visible: the program includes a records filter from the date immediately after the last definitive report.

Among the available options, the report headline visualization, useful to manage stamped modules already printed as well as the visualization of the definitive print, is really worth attention.

During the execution of the definitive print, the program controls if previous no-printed records are present as well as the presence, within a date range, of data already reported in the print. Once that the print process has been launched (so the simple preview does not make any operation but it is necessary going through the concrete print even of the files, regardless of the good result of the process), the related records are blocked in the whole fiscal part while the counters memorized in the “Ledger Accounts Parameters” are updated: within this table there are specific user rights to delete the definitive print with the related button: once selected, it is necessary to set the range of dates that have to be unblocked, confirm the operation and then manually update all the related counters.

The report, at least regarding the definitive operations, is run by setting the range of record dates, month by month.

RIBBON BAR: the ribbon bar represents the form menu, that is the area on which it is possible to perform actions. The possible feature list is the following:
