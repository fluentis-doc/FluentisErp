The interface presents the search filters at the top to identify the list of provisional records present in the system. Once one of the rows of the displayed record(s) is selected, the management buttons will be activated at the top: with 'Edit Record', it will be possible to open the record for editing, to address the various data and possibly directly modify the status of its parameters; with 'View Record', it will be possible to view the record without making any modifications; the last button 'Generation', on the other hand, will execute the status change according to the parameters set at the bottom of the interface, which we will detail now.

At the bottom of the interface, there are two fields for the registration date and the competency date to be used for definitively recording the selected provisional records, as well as the option 'Recording date equal to last date of VAT book'. If this flag is active, the accounting will occur at the last date used for each individual record's VAT register (if present), so as to place them at the end of the definitive records already present.
