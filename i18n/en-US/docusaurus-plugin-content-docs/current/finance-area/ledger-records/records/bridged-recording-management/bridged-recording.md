With this procedure, it is possible to modify the provisional records present in the general ledger to assign the definitive status without having to manually enter each one to change its status.

## Records (Registrazioni)

By performing the search according to the data set in the filter fields, the accounting entries in Provisional status will be displayed.

It is therefore possible to select the entries that you want to set to definitive status and proceed alternatively to:

- view the record (changes cannot be saved)  
- edit the record  
- generate definitive entries from the selected provisional ones  

The transformation into a definitive entry will occur with a date defined in the lower part of the form (it is possible to align the accounting competence date or change it) and automatically set the date to be equal to the last registration date on the VAT register.

The management of the VAT protocol will occur consistently with the settings of the registration date and the parameters that define the coherence of date / protocol number.

The registration number will also follow the consistency parameters and recovery of numbers based on the date.

## Previous (Precedenti)

As usual, it is possible to restore the single record contained in the modification operation or the entire operation performed by the user on a specific date.
