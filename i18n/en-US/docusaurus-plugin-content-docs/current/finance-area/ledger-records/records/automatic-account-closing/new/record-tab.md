The records, that are visible with a double click on the 'Record' Tab, are the following: (in the first grid) the first record closes the profit, the second one the costs, the third one by closing the economic account registers the profit or the loss, the fourth (in the second grid) closes the passive and the fifth closes the active (including the profit/loss accounts); in the third grid are reported the three opening records, the first one that opens the passive, the second one that opens the active, the third one that transfers the profit/loss account of a period to the profit/loss account of the previous period.

Possible errors, found later, can be removed: it is possible to delete the account closure directly and, when the program requests, to delete records linked to it so that it is possible to start the procedure from zero; otherwise it is possible to use the rollback button of the accounting. There are specific user-authorizations for the accounting and for the accounting-deletion. The account closure blocks records included in the set dates range and it will not be possible to enter records within that specific range.

Last detail: order accounts cannot be closed or re-opened in this procedure.
