 'Automatic Opening Accounts' procedure is one of the options that can be used to register activities starting balances: starting from the first balance closure, the following account openings are directly managed by the closing procedure. For this reason, the mask interest is low. This procedure only registers the opening ledger balances, not the re-opening of the related maturity values.

The procedure can create a 'new opening' whose functionalities are going to be explained in the following paragraphs.

**Opening Date**: is the date of the operation. It does not have any link with the record date of the operation that is indicated at the bottom of the window.

**Opening Number**: is a progressive number that is automatically managed.

**Description**: it enables the user to identify the operation as well as the notes.

**Detail Account** and **Account Type**: they represent search-filters within the list of the chart of accounts.

At the bottom of the mask it is necessary to set the **Record Date** and the **Accrual Date** that have to be assigned to the re-opening record.

**Number**: it is assigned once that the accounting has been done.

It is necessary to indicate the opening accounts template and the description of the movement to be assigned to the Journal.

Once that these mandatory data has been set, it is possible to save the settings and to activate the whole list of the detail accounts: the next step is to start the detail account memorization for the re-opening accounts credit/debit detail account balance, with the re-opening amount in the currency, if it is necessary. Once that the credit/debit amounts correspond, it is possible to start the balance retrieve in the accounting: the user can open the same account opening in order to complete all data (this procedure is long and can last some days); it is possible even to create many different account openings, grouping them for active/passive or for customer/vendor.

A rollback procedure is not included in the mask: it is simply necessary to delete the opening and the application asks delete confirmation of the related ledger record.

RIBBON BAR: it represents the form menu, that is the area in which it is possible to perform actions. The list of features is the following:



| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Save | Button to save the header of the opening accounts; it is active once that the description and the accounting template has been inserted. |
| Search | Button to search the list of accounts that the user wants to insert in the opening, through the 'detail account' and 'account type' fields. |
