The Job Order Tab is available only if the template has activated the flag “Job Order”.

In this Tab the economic data taken from the ledger accounting are assigned to the various selling job orders:  they are automatically assigned to the job order inserted into the upper part but the user can divide the amounts in different ways, even manually, directly in this section.

There are not automatisms during the manual insertion of amounts, nor the range of economic competence dates, nor the controls of the balance between amounts and general accounting.
