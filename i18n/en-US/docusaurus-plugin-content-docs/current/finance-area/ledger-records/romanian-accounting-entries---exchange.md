This mask has been created in order to enable the user to calculate, automatically to a certain date, the change differences for currency accounts and in order to create maturity values and regularization accounting records. 

Within the Parameters area there is a series of parameters with which it will be possible to realize the regularization accounting: 

**Temporary**: it enables the user to create the change difference as a temporary accounting record;

**Change**: with which it is possible to calculate the updated value. It is possible to propose it automatically by the program (starting from the currency change table), but the user can edit it;

**Date** and **Document Number** and **Accounting Template**: related to the accounting record to be regularized. The inserted date represents also the date up to which it is possible to select the accounting records;

**Costs and Revenues**: used in order to record the change differences;

Within the 'Restore' area it is possible to view the result of the regularization operations performed according to the filters set (From/To date, account). 

RIBBON BAR: the ribbon bar represents the Form menu, that is the area in which it is possible to perform actions. The list of features is the following: 



| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Search | Button to search accounts to be regularized according to the filters set.  |
| To Be Accounted | Button to regularize the accounts selected within the filters area and in correspondence to the parameters inserted into the related area.  |
| Restore Regularization | Button to delete the regularization operations selected into the result grid.  |

FILTER AREA: in this area it is possible to select the accounts to be regularized thanks to the following filters. The currency is part of the accounts, the account type (active/passive or of availability/maturity values) and the account. 

RESULT GRID: the result grid is located at the bottom of the window. It represents both the list of accounts, that correspond to filter data above mentioned, and values, that will be elaborated through the regularization procedure (historical value, tha value updated according to the change inserted into the parameters area, the change difference).
