title: Control of Balance for CC/PC/Job Orders
sidebar_position: 4
---

With this control report, accounting movements are extracted that do not respect the equality of valuation between accounting movements and movements to cost center, profit, or sales order: for companies that have activated controlling management, it will be possible to analyze the balancing of each dimension of the business centers.

It is reminded that it is possible, within the settings of **[general ledger templates](/docs/configurations/tables/finance/ledger-records-templates/insert-ledger-records-templates)**, to bind users at the time of saving accounting records to ensure the equality of data at the source.
