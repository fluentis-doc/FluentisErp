The cost center analysis report allows for printing the details of accounting transactions that have valued each individual cost center, totaling amounts for the cost center itself.

There is a filter area in the form with various fields, among which the main ones are the business center and the accounting account.

At the bottom area, there are grouping criteria.

A typical useful grouping criterion is the business center to observe the movements of the various accounts distinguished by each center.

Regarding the use of grouping criteria, see **[Movements Summary for Template](/docs/finance-area/ledger-records/accounting-report/movements-summary-for-template)**.
