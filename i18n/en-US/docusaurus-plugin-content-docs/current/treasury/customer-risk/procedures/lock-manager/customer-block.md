The second card, 'Block Customer', enables the user to force an 'orders block' or 'DN block' (or both) for a specific customer list, together with a block dates range. For example, if user has an unpaid cash order, the administration could access to this mask and forces the block of all operations about customer. In order to enable customer it will be necessary to set a validity end date (so that it could be possible to keep track of block) or to delete the system line directly. It is possible to record customer and block/unblock date.

RIBBON BAR: it represents the Form menu, that is the area in which it is possible to perform actions linked to the mask in management. The list of features is the following:



| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Search | It searches the customer list according to filters applied |
| Delete | It deletes the selected customer in the result grid |
