The mask shows the collection record detail about customer, within the date range and filters inserted into header. The calculation regards the count of numbers linked to variances about collection currency days and numbers linked to due date variances days (of previous line) in order to calculate a medium collection currency and a medium due date currency (in case of bills the currency date is the same as due date, independently of bill accounting date). After Â having calculated the difference between these two values, it is possible to obtain a medium number of delayed days between due date and currency: this number of days can be recorded (through the 'Update Days of Delay' button) in register field 'Delay Medium Days' used during cash flow simulations in order to obtain the estimated due date of financial flow.

The mask offers a report about the calculation detail.
