The Customer Risk module of Fluentis ERP is a useful tool for monitoring and managing the financial risk associated with customers, ensuring constant control of the company's credit exposure. This module allows for the analysis and evaluation of the risk of customer insolvency, helping businesses make informed decisions and improve credit management.

The module enables the operator to define and control customer credit limits. For each customer, the credit limit value and monitoring method will be defined, either through a simple notification or a block in case of exceeding the limit. User roles and rights for authorized users to unblock documents for potential exceptions to the limit can also be defined.

The module is present in the treasury area and draws data from the active document flow, accounting data, and the effects portfolio.

A series of settings, both predetermined table settings and correct parameterization of the basic algorithms, are recommended before proceeding with customer risk management.

 Main Features 

- Credit exposure monitoring: The module allows for defining customized credit limits for each customer and continuously monitoring their financial exposure by comparing available credit with utilized credit.

- Risk assessment: It integrates analytical tools that classify customers based on their payment behavior, such as average payment delays, allowing for proactive decisions in managing credits and cash flows.

- Automatic blocks and alerts: If a customer exceeds credit limits or has overdue invoices, the system can activate automatic blocks on the creation of new orders or send alerts to the sales or administrative department.

- Integration with accounting: The module is fully integrated with general ledger and accounts management, from which it reads data to update risk exposure reporting and the utilization of each customer's credit limit. It is also interfaced with the active cycle, intervening directly in the creation of documents, orders, delivery notes, and invoices, in order to notify or block the fulfillment process if the limit is exceeded.



**Tables:** There are no specific tables for this module; however, it should be noted that various document types in purchase and sale have settings related to customer risk ([tables related to the Customer Risk module](/docs/configurations/tables/treasury/customer-risk-module-tables)).
