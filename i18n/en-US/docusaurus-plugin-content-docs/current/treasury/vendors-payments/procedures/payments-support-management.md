From this form, you manage the data of the bank supports provided for payments (and possibly for collections). Within the customer/supplier registries, it is possible to define the default payment bank detail account: based on this, each entry, at the time of its creation, is channeled to this account, but the data can be modified from this form.

In addition to this function, the form allows you to view the statement within which the entry has been paid, as well as to manually record the receipt of the payment notice, its verification, and the confirmation of its sending through the relevant flags in the grid.

The precise management of payment support is very useful for subsequently obtaining a processing of the **[*Cash Flow*](/docs/treasury/cash-flow/reports)** grouped by bank, in order to understand the trend and consistency, not only of the overall cash flow but also to evaluate the situation and the possible overdraft of each individual company bank account.
