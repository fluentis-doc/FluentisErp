In this mask it is possible to reconciliate the imported flux from home banking with accounting movements.

There are two sections: on the left, the **imported movements** and on the right the **accounting movements**. Both sections have a filter list: it is important to remember, in particular, the possibility to view only not reconciled movements, only reconciled movements or all movements.

Once having selected the right lines in both sections, these could be reconciliated thanks to the 'Reconciled Movements' button. On the contrary, two lines, already reconciled, could be disconnected by selecting them and clicking on 'Disconnect Movements' button.

On mask there is a 'View Records' button which enables the user to view the selected accounting record on the right section.
