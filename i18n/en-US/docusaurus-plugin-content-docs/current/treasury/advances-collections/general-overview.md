The advances collections module is dedicated to the creation and management of advances on invoice.

The module is located within the Treasury Area in Advances_Collections module.

The basic setting can be performed within the Advances Lists Types table, where it is possible to encode more list typologies. It is not necessary to have specific accounting templates: the record performed by the module refers to the collection record from customer that can use standard accounting template, while the other records will be performed manually within the financial accounting.

The management provides for the creation of a new advance list, with type, date, status and description: once having inserted these data it will be possible to create a list by identifying, through two management buttons, which invoice to be anticipated, or which single maturities to be presented in list. Through this mask it will be possible to go on to print the list.

The module provides for two alignment types of advances situation: as regards lists managed with maturities acquisition, it will be possible to detect the advance directly from the accounting procedure on module, obtaining so an automatic update of the advances account situation. The alternative refers to the manual management within the 'advances management' mask.

In addition to this, there are some standard control reports to be associated to the advances list report.
