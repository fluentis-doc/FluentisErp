The first mask is dedicated to the search filters of maturities to be collected: it is really important to remember that in this mask it is possible to view automatically only maturity values that have been anticipated, but also to set search flags in order to show all active maturity values, even the not anticipated ones.

RIBBON BAR: the ribbon bar represents the Form menu, that is the area on which it is possible to perform actions linked to the procedure in use. The possible features list is the following:



| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Search  | It searches the maturities to be accounted. |
| Accounting | Button to create the ledger record of the selected maturities. |

FILTER AREA: the filter area contains the list of possible data types thanks to which it is possible to perform the selection. Typically filters have always “AND” condition and it is possible to specify more search filter at the same time.

RESULT GRID: the result grid represents the list of advances lists that correspond to filter data, above mentioned. After having specified values through which to obtain a search of advance lists, the user, by clicking on the [Search] button on the related Ribbon, will obtain the list of the desired invoices on the result grid.
