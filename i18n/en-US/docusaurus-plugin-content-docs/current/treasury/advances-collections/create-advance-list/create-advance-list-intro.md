First of all, the advance list header provides for the selection of the list type to be used: the following number is attributed automatically, as well as year and current date of system (both presentation date and issue date).

On **Bank c/a** field it is necessary to set the detail account of bank register on which invoices will be presented on advance. Once having assigned a description to this list, it is necessary to set even its status: manual management of status has to be set on 'list issued' or on 'list presented'. Once having confirmed data, system will save header data and activate the following selection buttons, thanks to which the user will have the possibility to refer to the invoices of sales area or the single maturities in invoice: remember that, a list can be managed only thanks to invoice help or maturities help, and it cannot obtain data from both.

Within the mask there is an execution button of the print preview and of the same direct report.
