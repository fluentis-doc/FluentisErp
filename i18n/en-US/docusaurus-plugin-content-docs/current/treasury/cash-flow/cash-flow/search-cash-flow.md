From this form, it is possible to search for and modify previous entries. 

It is also possible to enter a new processing, which in this case would be completely manual (and therefore of limited practical use).

It is recommended to create the cash flow from the **[Automatic cash flow generation](/docs/treasury/cash-flow/procedures)** procedure.
