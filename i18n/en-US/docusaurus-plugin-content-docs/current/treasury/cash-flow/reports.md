The form can be found under Treasury > Cash Flow > Report > Cash Flow Analysis.

From this screen, it is possible to obtain the printout of the cash flow calculations that have been calculated and are present in the system: the system, upon opening, suggests the last calculation performed by the current user as a filter.

The following filters can be set: 

- which types of flow to include in the printout, by disabling the **All flux types** flag and selecting the desired types from the grid.
 
- the 6 reference dates for the calculations, by modifying the corresponding fields in the **Summary to the following maturities** section.

- the **Report type** to be displayed, grouping by flow type or payment type.

- the **data display** channeled **by bank**, 

- the filter for **Project** (e.g., job order), 

- the display of **Details** for each single flow (e.g., all orders, all delivery notes, etc.).

- The **Expected date** flag that shows the flows concerning the expected date instead of the default date, which is the *Expiry date* (if the expected date has not been changed, by default it corresponds to the due date).
