## Search Filters

- **Types of Bills:** Filters based on the type of Bill that was entered in the unpaid invoice during creation, such as Bank Receipt, Bill of Exchange, etc.
- **Debtor:** Filter related to the ***Debtor*** field present within the Bill.
- **From / To / Unpaid Date / Expiry Date / Issue Date / Number:** Related to the corresponding fields present within the unpaid invoice, particularly concerning the creation date of the unpaid invoice, the due date of the installment that reopens with the unpaid invoice, the issue date of the Bill that went unpaid, and the number of the unpaid Bill.
- **Unpaid Status:** Filter related to the *Unpaid Status* present within the unpaid invoice, which is automatically modified depending on the procedures that have been carried out. For example, it starts as Unpaid, then becomes Collected, or a debit note is issued, etc.
- **Filter Flag:** By default, *All* is active, but it can be changed by selecting various search conditions that, if activated simultaneously, will broaden the search base, such as printed + accounted + NOT printed..... There is also an additional expandable section to filter unpaid invoices coming from Bills generated by installments or invoices with respective references of date/number. This helps the search as the two procedures for creating the Bill are alternative to each other.
