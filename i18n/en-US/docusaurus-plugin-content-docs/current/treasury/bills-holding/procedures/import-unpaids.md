From this form, the importation of the arrears list from the standard electronic banking communication file can be performed.

It is generally possible to activate the reception of a trail of this list, which partially replicates the same file sent during the submission, within which we have included the identifier of the effect: by reading this data, we can automatically create the arrears list, with direct detection of the bank fees on each one.

The procedure begins with the **Execute Import** button, which will open the system's file opening mask: once the file is located in the correct directory, simply opening the file will proceed with the importation of the list.

Any list of missing effects will be displayed in an error mask: for these, it will be necessary to proceed with the manual creation of the arrears.

From the mask, it is possible to delete the executed import: this will cancel the list of arrears created with the import itself.
