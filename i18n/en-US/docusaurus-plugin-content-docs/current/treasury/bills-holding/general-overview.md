The Fluentis ERP Effects Portfolio module is designed to manage and monitor commercial effects, such as drafts, bank receipts, and other deferred payment instruments. 

This module allows for the management of all operations related to effects, from their creation to presentation at the bank for good completion or collection, up to the recording of the final credits of collected amounts, providing complete control over cash flows resulting from deferred payments.

## The operational flow: 

- starts by retrieving data from sales invoices or accounting entries. 

- Executes the closing of the customer account, the generation of the presentation lists, and the possible creation of the final default. 

It is possible to define the various types of necessary effects at will. 

The **Cash order**, currently the most used instrument in Italy, are already present in the system (following the initial Fast Start configuration).
