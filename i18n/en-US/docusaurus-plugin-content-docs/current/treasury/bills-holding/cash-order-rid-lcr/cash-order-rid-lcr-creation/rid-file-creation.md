Through this mask it is possible to generate the electronic tracing for RID presentation lists.

The upper part of the mask has the task to define search filters of lists issued but for which file has not been created.

Once having identified the list to be managed, at the base of the mask it is possible to view and manage the automatic data as they have been defined in parameters: file creation date, its name (set as [ListDate]_[ListNumber].RID), file creation path, company name and description of invoice references to be inserted. At the base of the mask there are management flags of the returned file and the exclusion of references management for unpaids.

In order to perform the creation of file it is necessary only to click on generation button: program will control obligatory data to be inserted in tracing (but not the correct value inserted obligatory), returning (if there are some errors) on a mask with details about errors detected
