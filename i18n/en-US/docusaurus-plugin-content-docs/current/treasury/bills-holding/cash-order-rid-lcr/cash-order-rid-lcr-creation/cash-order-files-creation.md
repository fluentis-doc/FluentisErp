Through this mas kit is possible to generate the electronic tracing for bank receipts presentation list.

The upper part of the mask has the task to define search filters of lists issued but for which file has not been created.

Once having identified the list to be managed, at the base of the mask it is possible to view and manage the automatic data as they have been defined in parameters: file creation date, its name (set as [ListDate]_[ListNumber].RIB), file creation path, company name and description of invoice references to be inserted. At the base of the mask there are management flags of the returned file and the exclusion of references management for unpaids.
