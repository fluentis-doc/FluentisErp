Through this mask it is possible to create a new list: the mask is the same on evene for the opening of an already saved list in order to edit/view it.

In the first field it is possible to indicate the list typology to be generated: program will numerate list progressively according to the numerator linked to the type for reference year, assigned according to the system date year.

The list currency is proposed according to the active company currency: if the currency assigned is different than euro, this will constrain the insertion into the list of bills expressed on the same currency.

The detail accounts section can be valorized automatically according to the selected list type setting: it regards a detail account linked to the bank register on which the final credit will occur in order to ensure the success of the operation and of the transitory presentation detail account.

On the right it is possible to set the list typology in creation: usually the predefined collection under usual reserveÂ  is the management standard typology. In case of list to discount the program will perform a discount calculation according to passive interest rates on bank register.

The credit line situation proposes credit data under usual reserve recorded in register and also the available remainder according to the bills amount presented but not yet accounted.

A series of flags records if the list has been printed (this condition is obligatory in order to be accounted), if an electronic file has been created, if it has been accounted and if it is a RID list related to consumption.

Once having completed list it will be possible to print the same list directly. The printed list status is necessary in order to perform its accounting, that can be fulfilled directly from this mask: it will be necessary to determine the accounting template within module parameters.
