The 'Payments' tab is active only if there is list type with 'Bills by Vendor' flag: this tab has to identify vendor maturity values to be closed with giro of bills that are in the same list. The total 'Payments' section will have to be the same as the total giro bills: in order to obtain this situation it is possible to insert a difference manual line, that will be managed as maturity value opening of vendor if the accounting template used provides for the same maturity values opening.
