Within parameters section it is possible to set the management details: the accounting template is proposed according to module parameters, record dates are proposed as current date; detail accounts are taken by module parameters, but they can be edited or inserted from time to time.

The **Summary Accounting** flag will notice through an onlyone record all unpaids presented on the same lending institution: usually this option is not very used, in particular in case that the invoice date and number obligatoriness has been inserted into accounting template to be used.

The **Charges Recourse** flag imposes the survey of customer cost debit: at the base of the mask, through this option, it will be possible to activate the management section about the possibility to invoice these costs rather than to record them directly in accounting. In addition in this section all fields will have to be set in order to create the sales invoice.

Lastly, it is necessary to insert obligatory payment type and due date to be assigned in order to open again the maturity value: in this particular case the software will not read the customer register (not entering the accounting record of this module to edit it), but the user will have to indicate from time to time which payment type to be attributed and the related due date (this will be usually the same as the due date of unpaid bill). The 'Due Date equal to bill due date' flag will impose the ERP to assign the same due date as regards unpaid bill.
