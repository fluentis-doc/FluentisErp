The bills search form 
- is located in Treasury > Bills Portfolio > Bills > Bills

- allows the user to search for previously issued bills with the aim of viewing, modifying, and possibly deleting them.

From this form, it is also possible to manually enter a new bill, but this mode is rarely used in practice. Usually, creation procedures are followed through automatic bills creation (from transactions or invoices).
