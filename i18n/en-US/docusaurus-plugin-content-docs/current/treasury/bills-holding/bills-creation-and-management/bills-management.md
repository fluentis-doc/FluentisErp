Through this mask it is possible to manage bill: the mask is the same both for a new bill creation and bill modification/visualization.

In the first field there is the bill type in use: in the event of an insertion, the program will assign a number according to the numerator linked to bill type and reference year, that proposes as year the system date year.

The currency and bill amount fields can be inserted manually or managed automatically according to maturity values/due dates selected by the related masks. Stamp amount is in a not used field.

The currency date corresponds to the exchange date in case of bills in currency.

The obligatory elements to be indicated concern due date, currency and exchange, debtor customer and banking centre (compiled according to customer register).

The agent is a simple field that refers to the main agent of original invoice.

The bill status is proposed as “issued” and it will be updated automatically according to operations that will be performed by bill.

The “Printed” flag is not managed, while the accounted and credited depend on bills and credits accounting procedures performed.

The references field is a free field, that is reported in file as reference to the operation instead of the text with parameters references (e.g.: in order to insert italian CIG references of construction site).
