In this section it is possible to view the original maturity values references (in case of bills acquisition from maturity values) or to add manually maturity values through the insertion button.

It is important to remember that starting from maturity values help it is possible to insert even the maturity values not linked to bank receipts as well as maturity values linked to credit notes. At the end there is a button that is necessary in order to divide maturity values: the operation will create a lot of maturity values and due dates mantaining the database links integrity.
