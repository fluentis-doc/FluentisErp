From this position, advance statements already present in the system are searched, which can be opened for viewing or modification with a double click.

It is also possible to proceed with the insertion of a new statement using the **New*** button.

In the header of the form, there are **filters** for searching related to:

- ordinary current accounts (conti correnti (ordinari))
- bank advance support accounts (conti d'appoggio per l'anticipo da parte della banca)
- statement number (numero distinta)
- submission date (data presentazione)
- calculation type (tipo di calcolo)
- statement status (stato della distinta).

The **Accounted** flag marks and filters statements for which the [**Accounting**](/docs/treasury/advance/accounting/advances-list-accounting) has already been launched or not.

The form also displays:

**Total Statement (Totale Distinta):** Calculated field that represents the sum of the total of the anticipated invoices.

**Total Advanced (Totale Anticipato):** Calculated field that represents the sum of the amount advanced by the bank for each invoice.
