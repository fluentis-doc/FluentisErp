sidebar_position: 1

From this position, after pressing Search, it is possible to account for the various entries made.

A transaction will be performed that credits the bank account and in return recognizes the debt to the bank for advances.

It is necessary to select the desired **ledger template** (the recording scheme is managed by the program regardless of the template) and optionally change the recording date if necessary.

The accounting procedure can be reverted as usual from the **Previous** tab.
