title: Advances Collections Accounting
sidebar_position: 2
---

From this position, the collections of invoices or due dates anticipated by the bank are managed accounting-wise.

Operating from here, two accounting entries will be automatically generated that reverse the open debt for the down payment and thus record the collection of the receivable net of commissions and interest.

In the Parameters tab, it is necessary to enter the accounts to be used for the collection, for any discounts, and the amounts of any commissions and interest, in addition to the accounting reason to be used for the collection.

Again, the structure of the entry is fixed regardless of the template of the selected reason.

In the Due Dates tab, it is possible to search and filter the due dates to be collected by selecting with the appropriate flag whether to look for already anticipated due dates in the list or not; it is also possible to exclude or include active due dates related to suppliers.

The accounting can be canceled and restored, as usual, from the **Currency adjustment rollback** tab.
