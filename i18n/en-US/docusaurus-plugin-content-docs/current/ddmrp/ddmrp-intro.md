:::important[Info]
The DDMRP module (**Demand Driven Material Requirements Planning**) in Fluntis ERP is designed to optimize inventory and production management, adopting an innovative and reactive approach to actual demand. DDMRP represents an evolution of traditional MRP (Material Requirements Planning), integrating the concepts of Lean Manufacturing and Supply Chain Management to improve resource management in complex and ever-changing environments.

The primary objective of the module is to help companies reduce inventory levels and improve service reliability, while protecting operational flows from variability in demand and supply. DDMRP allows for the identification of strategic points along the supply chain, where stock buffers are positioned to serve as cushions against fluctuations.

Among the main features of the DDMRP module in Fluntis ERP, we find:

- Strategic positioning of buffers: Identifies critical points in the supply chain where buffers need to be positioned to absorb changes in demand and supply.

- Dynamic buffer levels: Dynamically adjusts stock levels based on factors such as demand variability, lead times, and operational performance.

- Demand-driven planning: Unlike traditional systems based on forecasts, DDMRP focuses on actual orders, allowing for more immediate responsiveness and a reduction in safety stock.

- Visibility and control: Provides advanced tools for monitoring and controlling material flows, reducing complexity and improving decision-making capabilities.

Thanks to these functionalities, the DDMRP module enables companies to optimize production processes, reduce inventory-related costs, and improve customer service, making the entire supply chain more efficient and resilient.

:::tip[Note]
The **Ddmrp methodology** is natively implemented within Fluentis, so it is not an external module or software that interacts with the related database. 

All Ddmrp Fluentis functionalities have been verified by the **Demand Driven Institute**, which has certified the Fluentis Ddmrp solution. 

The documentation provided here allows understanding of how this methodology is applied and reviews its main concepts; however, it is not intended to be a guide to the Ddmrp "method," therefore, the user intending to use Ddmrp functionalities must be familiar with its content and have learned it through appropriate courses or official documentation.

The documentation is divided into the following areas: 

[**Registers**](/docs/ddmrp/master-data/introduction)

[**Procedures**](/docs/ddmrp/procedures/ADU-update)

[**FORMS and REPORTS**](/docs/ddmrp/views_and_forms/buffer-status)
