This report shows the working capital typically invested in the inventory of items managed according to DDMRP logic.

The valuation of such inventory is carried out through the procedure [**inventory values of items** (/docs/ddmrp/procedures/inventory-value)].

There are two types of reports:

- by item, with details for each item and potentially by warehouse if the report for all warehouses is chosen, allowing for the comparison of capital invested in each item across different warehouses.

- by warehouse, it shows the total working capital for each warehouse over a selected time period, allowing for the monitoring of the trend over time of the capital tied up in each warehouse.
