The value of the red zone is automatically calculated by the zone update procedure based on the DDMRP parameters of the item.

Through this table, it is possible to force a different value on specified dates.

The planning system takes into account any adjustment values of the zones in the NFP calculation even if the zone update procedure has not been executed.

The calculation of the buffer status also considers any exception of the red zone even if the zone update procedure has not been executed.

Typically, red zone exceptions are used if, for a limited period of time, there is knowledge of some event that temporarily increases the supply risk.
