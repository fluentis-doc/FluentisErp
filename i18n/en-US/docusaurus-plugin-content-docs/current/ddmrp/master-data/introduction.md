In this section, there are the data records related to items managed according to DDMRP logic, namely the so-called buffers, which are strategic stocks sized and replenished according to DDMRP logic.

In the DDMRP system, there are three types of stocks:

Dynamic buffers allow for variation over time in the three characteristic zones (green, yellow, red), and consequently also the average stock level. Fixed buffers instead use fixed values for the zones and, therefore, also a fixed average stock level (they are used in case of space limitations, investment constraints, safety limits, etc.). Min-max buffers use only the red zone and the green zone.
