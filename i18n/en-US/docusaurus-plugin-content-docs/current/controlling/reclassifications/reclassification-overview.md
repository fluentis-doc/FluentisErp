The **Reporting** module allows the operator to manage budget reclassifications, both on general accounting data and on analytical accounting data by cost center. In addition to reports, there is a powerful procedure for comparing the processed reclassifications, both on general data and on management accounting data, allowing the comparison of different analysis areas and periods (months or weeks depending on the initial configuration). The module is available in the *Controlling* area and reads source data processed in the *Mid-year closure* or in the *Management Records*: this second option is available only for companies that have activated and configured *Controlling*.
