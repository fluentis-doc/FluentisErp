From the search form, it is possible to search for and insert, via the **New** button, off-balance budget records.

To insert a new movement, it is mandatory to select an [**Area**](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/area-types-areas) for analysis (it is recommended to code it appropriately, for example *Budget* to distinguish it, for instance, from *Final* or *Simulation*, etc....)

The next step is to select a ledger template (similarly to what is required for accounting movements) and a date. 
The reference currency, Euro or another currency, is to be indicated.

You then proceed by entering, as usual, the bub-accounts, any associated project/job order, and the debit/credit values. 
The movements are associated with the business division (a fundamental element, especially in the presence of multiple divisions).
