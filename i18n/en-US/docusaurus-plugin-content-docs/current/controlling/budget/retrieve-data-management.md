Through this mask it is possible to assign data of mid-year closures to the various reclassification patterns: it is important to remember that it is necessary that the closure has a connection to the budget period and to the period detail. The creation of a new data retrieve will propose on header the last available closure for data retrieve: once having set a description, the program will show the list of budget periods on grids below, that are consistent with the dates range inserted into closure and the sub-budgets detail for which it is possible to retrieve data. Once having selected all these elements it will be necessary to click on “Creation” button of data retrieve in order to assign the related values. It is important to remember that in case of sub-budgets on pattern it is necessary to create a reclassification that can valorize pattern calculations for final balance to budget.
