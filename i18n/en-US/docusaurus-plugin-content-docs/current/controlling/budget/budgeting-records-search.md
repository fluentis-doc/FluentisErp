From the search form, it is possible to search and insert, via the **New** button, the Budget records for the individual periods.

To insert a new record, it is mandatory to select an [***Area***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/area-types-areas) of analysis, which can only be one of those associated with a [***Area type***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/area-types-areas) of Budget.

The next step is to select an ledger template (similarly to the provisions for accounting movements) and a date. 
The reference currency must also be indicated, either Euro or another currency.

In the details grid, it will then be possible to enter, as usual, the bub-accounts, the related corporate centers connected to the respective Dimension, any associated project or job order, and the debit/credit values. The movements must be linked to the business division.
