The valorization of budget on pattern can be performed according to the various groupings defined on structure: the variances analysis will be linked to the structure detail, without valorizing the single specific source value.

The data loading can be of two types: manual, by giving the amount for an element of each level present; or automatic according to updating flags set on various sub-budgets. The sub-budgets with different types as detail account, C.C and P.C will be the valorization source data of details about pattern groupings for the sub-budget that in turn has set the flag.
