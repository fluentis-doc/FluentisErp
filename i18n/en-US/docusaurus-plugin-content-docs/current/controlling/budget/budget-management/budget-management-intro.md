The loading provides for the budget type definition, its description, reference period, currency and possible link to the sales job order.

Once having saved header data it will be possible to go on to set sub-budgets that make the same budget: there is not a particular limit to the number of sub-budgets, but there could be N. records belonging to the same typology. Every sub-budget has to set a specific description and the possible automatic updating flag: this flag is active for sub-budgets per detail accounts, C.C and P.C in order to identify which are the source data of sub-budget, on the contrary the sub-budget flag per pattern will identify which sub-budgets will be automatically updated.

RIBBON BAR: the ribbon bar represents the Form menu, that is the area on which it is possible to perform actions linked to the budget in management. The possible features list is the following:
