The sixth step involves assets, specifically the depreciation quotas that represent an important component in structuring our costs.

From a management control perspective, it is important to be able to calculate these depreciation quotas with a *technical* outlook, freeing ourselves from the fiscal and legal logics that are distorted compared to the needs of control. We must have the option to eventually replace the historical purchase cost with a replacement cost, thus a more updated cost, and have the ability to establish the technical duration independently of the ministerial tables, just as we can apply depreciation without checking the residual value to consider the cost of the machinery even when it is fully depreciated from an accounting perspective.
Through the technical duration, identify the depreciation quotas calculated based on the solar days of the year and not tied to the fiscal product logics, which for the first year are 50%; it can be depreciated regardless of the date it becomes operational. For example, if I purchase an asset on January 1st or December 31st, it makes no fiscal difference since I always have a 50% depreciable quota. Administratively, this is not suitable because if I purchase it on January 1st, I will have 365 days of depreciation to consider, while if I purchase it on December 31st, I will only have one day.
It is therefore important to carefully evaluate the asset situation (e.g., for a company with an outdated fleet of machines to renew, it is probably worth considering the application of 'depreciation without residual value' to avoid overestimating the product/project margin that is obtained.)


:::tip Note 
The processing of accounting period depreciation data and off-balance in managerial accounting can be executed in parallel, with the caution of excluding the use of accounting data in controlling from the chart of accounts: one will be relevant for mid-year closings and therefore for the reclassified accounting balance sheet, while the other will be used off-balance only within the controlling simulations.
