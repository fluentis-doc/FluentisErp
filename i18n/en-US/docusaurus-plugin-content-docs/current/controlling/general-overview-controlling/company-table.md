The first decision to make is regarding the type of controlling that the company wants to manage: if the goal is to build a system of business centers, connected by cost/revenue value shifting logic, in order to enhance the analytical accounting in all its features, it is necessary to enter the ***Company Table*** and set the management flag for *Controlling*, which is found in the *Other Settings* tab.

We will continue the configuration by moving to the *Departments* grid at the top right, where we will set the frequency to *monthly* (which is the default option) or *weekly*.

Generally in controlling, we only value the economic movements of costs and revenues; if we want to include balance sheet items as well, we can set the flag 'Import asset in controlling'.

:::tip Note
If the company is only interested in the management of mid-year accounting balances or in a basic configuration of business centers that does not involve shifting drivers between them, the *Controlling* management in the company table can be omitted.
