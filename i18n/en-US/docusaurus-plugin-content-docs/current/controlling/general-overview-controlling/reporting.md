We can divide reporting into two types:

***CORPORATE INCOME STATEMENT (REPORTING CORPORATE):*** the classic income statement based on contribution margin rather than added value or produced/sold value;   
***CENTER INCOME STATEMENT:*** through which, based on the cost driver for measuring the center, we are able to determine our parametric rate which, regarding production centers, is almost always euro/hour. We will use this rate for cost allocation at the level of job orders or product regarding the time spent for the transformation.

Naturally, this reporting should also have the ability to compare different periods or times to enable a minimum analysis of variances. For example, for different areas, we could compare actual results against a budget.

For companies that value the [*project/job orders dimension*](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/dimension), the procedure for printing the project report, always based on a specific [*Reclassification Model*](/docs/controlling/reclassifications/create-reclassification-model), will be available.
