The print report allows you to perform a synthetic print of the basic balance sections on the data of the selected mid-year closing (or consolidation). It is allowed to view amounts with a negative sign and/or to view the balance without the details of the balances for customer/supplier registers, to view the detailed balance in currency for accounts that have active currency management in the chart of accounts, and to make a comparison between two specific mid-year closures.
