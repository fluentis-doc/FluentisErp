The search for off-balance records allows you to view all movements associated with a specific ***Mid-year closing***. The interface will have all buttons disabled until the specific mid-year closing you wish to operate on is set.

From this interface, it will be possible to: find and modify the records associated with the mid-year closing; delete the records associated with the mid-year closing; add manual records to the mid-year closing (e.g., record the accruals of payroll expenses); duplicate a selected manual record (not those automatically created with the module procedures) in another already existing closing in the module.

Creating an off-balance record is very similar to creating a journal record: you will always select a general ledger template, and from there, you will proceed with the record (the only difference is that there is no concept of VAT protocol in the interim period: the module, however, is a copy that provides the same logical tables as accounting, although physically different to avoid contaminating the official accounting data in any way). Off-balance records are only allowed for movements by cost/profit center.
