The Search Off Balance Sheet Records procedure enables the user to view all movements associated to a specific mid-year closure. The mask will have all buttons disabled up to when the user will decide and set on which mid-year closure to operate.

Through this mask it is possible to: find and edit records associated to the mid-year closure; delete records associated to the mid-year closures; add manual records to the mid-year closure (e.g.: to detect oddments on date); duplicate a manual record (not the automatic ones that have been created thanks to the module procedures) selected in a grid in another module closure.

The creation of an off-balance record is similar to the creation of a petty cash book record: it will be possible to select always a financial accounting template and starting from this it will be possible to go on to the record (the only one difference is that it does not exist the concept of VAT protocol on the mid-year closure: anyway the module represents a copy which provides for the same logic accounting tables, while being physically different, in order not to pollute official accounting data). Off-balance records are allowed as regards movements for cost/profit centre.

RIBBON BAR: it represents the Form menu, that is the area in which it is possible to perform actions linked to the procedure in use. The list of features is the following:

| --- | --- |
| Search Record | It performs the search of records according to filter set |
| New Record | It creates a new off-balance record associated to the selected mid-year closure |
| Edit the Selected Record | It edits the selected off-balance record. If the closure is “definitive” the records linked will not be edited. |
| View the Selected Record | It views the selected record. |
| Delete | It deletes the selected off-balance record |
| Copy Record | It copies the selected record in another closure to be identified in the duplication mask that could be opened through the same button. It is not possible to duplicate records created by automatic procedures (as depreciations retrieve, adjustment/integration records etc.). |
