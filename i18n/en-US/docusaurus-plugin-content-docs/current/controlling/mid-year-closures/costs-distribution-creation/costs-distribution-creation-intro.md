The procedure provides the creation of a new costs distribution together with indication of version number, insertion date, its description and mid-year closure from which to take data.

Once having saved header data it will be possible to enable the section below: on the left section it will be possible to indicate a grouping code of the following cost centre taken by closure. Saved this cost centre, on the right there will be the possibility to assign a percentage value to this cost centre on profit centres (taken always by the closure).

Once having completed the values assignment, through the 'View Distributions' it will be possible to view a summary mask of results of the various profit centres.
