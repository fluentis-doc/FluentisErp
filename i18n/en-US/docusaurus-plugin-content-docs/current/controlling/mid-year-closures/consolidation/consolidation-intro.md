The procedure will enable the user to link the mid-year closures of the different companies that are on database, in order to create a consolidated group balance sheet to be printed or valorized in a reclassified balance sheet.

On mask header it is necessary to insert an operation description and a record template: it will be possible, for this reason, to detect the reversal of intercompany costs and revenues and opened credits/debits, according to the logic specified hereinafter.

Within the company table, line by line, it is possible to associate a register: from this register it will be possible to detect the customer/vendor detail accounts of group (e.g. in company X it will be possible to view if register, linked to the company Y is encoded, as customer and/or vendor). From records to these detail accounts valorized in the selected closure, it will be possible to insert costs/revenues with an opposite sign into the new record; for the same detail accounts it will be possible to verify the opened maturity value, during the consolidation and it will be possible to transfer also balances of these ones.

In this section it is possible to manage the list of reclassifications to be compared.
