In the current tabulator there is the balances list for accounts and detail accounts of the closure set. There are 3 types of balance: 'General', 'Debit' and 'Credit' where the last two ones can view debit and credit amount for the inserted account/detail account, if it is required at the moment of the mid-year closureÂ  creation.
