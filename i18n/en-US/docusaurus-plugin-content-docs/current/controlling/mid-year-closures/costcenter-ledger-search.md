This window is dedicated to visualizing the data present in the analytics of the records created within an mid-term account closure.

Once the closure is set for which to view the data, one can request the movements of the centers by filtering them by account/detail account or by the code of [***Cost Center***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/cost-centers).
