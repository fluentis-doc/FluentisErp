During the opening of the mask below, it will be necessary to set:

- **Reference Closure** (from which the economic accrual date range is read)

- **Movement Record Date** in the off-balance records

- **Template** to be used (also here it is necessary that template provides for the management of CC/job orders in order to valorize them on record)

The **Single Record** flag to create an only one off-balance record with inside the various depreciation/fund detail accounts

By launching the data search, the program will valorize the mask grid with depreciation data to be calculated, proportionate to the number of closure accrual days. In particular, for each fixed asset it will be possible to valorize if the depreciation of the year (year set as closure parameter) is already present on its section and this value will be proportionate again on the number of days: if this does not occur, a calculation will be simulated (according to parameters of the related category and possible remains) and then this value will be proportionated to the number of accrual days.

Remember to select all lines that are in the grid, in order to be valorized during closure.
