This form is primarily used to search for and display records generated by the *Consolidation* procedure of the mid-year closures module.

You need to select the relevant consolidation from the appropriate combo box to view the related records.

As with the Off-balance Records, it will also be possible from this position to complete consolidation operations with entirely manual records (for example, for intra-company participations).

These records also require a reference ledger template: unlike normal records, each individual accounting line must indicate the company related to that specific line.
