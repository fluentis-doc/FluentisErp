Within the mid-year closures module it is possible to select the 'Adjustment Entry' procedure. The mask enables the user to manage apart the adjustment operations that can be performed as regards the creation of a new mid-year closure.

In order to manage the procedure it is necessary to set: reference closure, calendar type (it is recommended to use the solar calendar and the group per record) and template to be used (that has to have CC/PC flags in order to manage the integration of cost/profit centres).

Through this procedure the program will verify the cost/revenue lines that are in accounting according to record/accrual date range set in order to create accruals of days out of the accrual date range set for the closure. The accrual detail accounts to be used will correspond to those inserted into the chart of accounts in correspondence to the single cost/revenue detail account or to the generic detail account inserted into accounting parameters of the same mid-year closure year. On mask there is a restore/cancellation button of movements already recorded by this mask.

The grids at the base of the mask present the list of cost/revenues lines, that are in the mid-year closure, which will be the object of adjustment.

RIBBON BAR: it represents the Form menu, that is the area in which it is possible to perform actions linked to the procedure in use. The list of features is the following:



| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Make Records | It performs the off-balance survey of integration entry for the selected closure |
| Delete Records | It deletes the off-balance integration records for the selected closure |
