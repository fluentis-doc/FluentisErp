The form is used to search for processed closures and potentially delete them.

From this interface, it will be possible to search and view the parameters used in each individual closure, as well as create new closures or delete (an operation allowed only if no automatic procedures have been managed on the closure).
The flag 'Definitive' present in the grid allows the closure itself to become unmodifiable.


:::danger ATTENTION
It is not possible to reopen a closure once it has been made final!
