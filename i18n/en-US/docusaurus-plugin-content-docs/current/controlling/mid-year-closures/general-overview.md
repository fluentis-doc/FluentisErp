The module **Mid-Year Closures** allows the operator to manage off-balance simulations of periodic balance data: a series of automated procedures for taking and valuing typical records are available, which allow for the creation of a periodic competency balance. The module is present in the *Controlling* area and reads source data from general ledger.


## Getting Started 
There are no specific configuration tables other than those necessary for the valuation of the various source areas of data managed by the procedures of the module itself.

- Create a *Create a new mid-term accounts closure*, taking the balances of both general and analytical data from General Ledger.

- Apply the *Adjustment Records*, to value the accruals of costs/revenues outside the period of competency of the balance simulation.

- Add the *Integration Records*, to value the accruals of costs/revenues for records outside the closure but with economic values pertinent to the period.

- Perform the *Purchases and Sales Area Valorization*, to add the documents in transit in the active and passive cycles.

- Execute the *Fixed Assets Depreciation Retrieve*, to insert the depreciations of the closure period, according to civil/tax accounting logic.

- Manage the *Inventory Accounting*, to automatically value the initial and final inventories of the period in question.

- For multi-company installations, process the *Balance Sheet Consolidation*, to create a consolidated mid-year closure valued across the various companies managed in the installation.
