The mid-year closures creation has been created in order to enable the user to create new mid-year balance simulations.

The source of initial data refers always to the financial accounting situation at the moment of the same closure creation: program considers balances of the different detail accounts, according to closure creation parameters, in order to allow the extra-accounting adding of all operations as incomes, deferred, depreciations and manual records in order to perform a precise balance simulation. The operation has not any accounting bills type: indeed the mid-year closures module is managed by the financial accounting in completely divided database tables.

Let us see the various elements of the mask.
