The 'Parameters' section enables the user to set for certain account types or for single account/detail account, the balance type to be calculated. In detail:

 **General**: is the normal default situation. Through this option the ERP will be able to calculate a debit or credit balance and a general balance.

 **Debit/Credit**: Through this option the program will calculate a total of debit movements, a credit total and the related final balance.

The reference corresponds to the various reclassified options: in these it is possible to set only the 'Debit', 'Credit' or general value. In order to simplify, the detection of a cost in a reclassified (that is the total debit movements of X detail account) and its adjustments (that is the total credit movements of X detail account) in two different points of the reclassified can give a further information about the simple general algebraic 'debit' balance.
