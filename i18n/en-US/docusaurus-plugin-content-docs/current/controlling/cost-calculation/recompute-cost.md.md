The **Recompute Costs** procedure present in Controlling allows for the recalculation of the last and average costs of items based on warehouse movements. 
At the top of the mask, there is a filter where you can perform a more targeted search for items to be considered in the procedure; in the grid with the search results, it is possible to select the items to be included. The procedure is executed with the **Recompute Costs** button on the ribbon bar; the results of the calculation procedure will be reported directly in the items grid.

:::note Note
It is important to keep in mind that the warehouse movements considered by the procedure for calculating the *Latest Cost* or *Average Cost* are all those starting from the date of the last closing plus one day to today; furthermore, the movements must be carried out with templates that have the following flags enabled: *Update Latest Cost* and/or *Update Average Cost* and *Fiscal Interest*.
