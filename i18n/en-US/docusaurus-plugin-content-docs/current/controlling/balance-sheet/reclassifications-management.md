title: Reclassifications Management
sidebar_position: 8

During the opening of the mask, if the user insert a new reclassification, it is necessary then to set a unique code of 5 alphanumeric characters and the reclassification description, to insert the reclassification pattern and to obtain data of mid-year accounts closure to be used. If the user has set the 'Consolidated Balance Sheet' flag it will be possible to recall the intercompany consolidated balance sheet code to be managed in the reclassified balance sheet.

In addition on header of the mask there are a field of connection with the sales job orders, a field for the cost centres and a last one for the profit centres: once having set one of these fields, the Management Software will recalculate the structure of the reclassified balance sheet taking data by mid-year records linked to the filter set.

The last field of the reclassification header is called **Ref. ** **Closing for the Calculation per Increases**: in substance, it is an initial value on which program will calculate differences in order to valorize details with balance type 'Incremental' (see detail documentation about level types of detail accounts and job orders).

Below this section, on the left of the mask, it will be possible to propose the structure of the reclassification pattern valorized by data of closure/consolidated balance sheet set. By selecting a level of different type from 'children sum' or 'expression', the Management Software will shows two grids on the right: on the grid above there will be the possibility to view the closure (consolidated balance sheet) balances list consistent with settings of the same level; on the grid below there will be the possibility to edit directly the classified balance sheet without editing the reference pattern. It is possible even to intervene manually on data of the grid below, together with the opportunity to insert new lines manually.

RIBBON BAR: it represents the Form menu, that is the area in which it is possible to perform actions linked to the procedure in use. The list of features is the following:
