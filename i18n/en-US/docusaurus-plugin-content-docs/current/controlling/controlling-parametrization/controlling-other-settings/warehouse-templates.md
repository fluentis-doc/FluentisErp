For companies that have *Controlling* active, within the warehouse templates, there is a management flag for [***COST CENTERS***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/cost-centers), which allows for the automatic valuation of the centers present in the document within the warehouse loading/unloading records.
