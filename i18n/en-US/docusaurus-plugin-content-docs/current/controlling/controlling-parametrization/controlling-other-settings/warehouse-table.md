title: Warehouse Table 
sidebar_position: 6

Within the **WAREHOUSES** table, we have the option to associate a list of [***COST CENTERS***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/cost-centers) with each warehouse.

In particular, companies that **do not** have *Controlling* active will have a grid available to load a list of centers to be valued; while for those with **active** management, the grid will allow associating multiple centers, even with different [*dimensions*](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/dimension), essentially replicating the logic already detailed in the [*Chart of Accounts*](/docs/erp-home/registers/accounting/analytic-chart-of-accounts) (thus also allowing the center to be left empty and only the active dimension to be valued).

:::tip Note 
The profit center is visible for backward compatibility; in companies with *Controlling* active, it is recommended to replace profit centers with a specific dimension to be valued in the corporate centers.
