The links between corporate centers in production configurations are essentially two:

- In the ***Machines*** table, we can associate the reference [***COST CENTER***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/cost-centers) with each individual machine.

- In the ***Labour Groups*** table, we can associate the reference [***COST CENTER***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/cost-centers) with each group.

:::tip Note
We remind you that to make corporate centers visible at the production tables level, the corporate center must have the *Visible in production* flag checked.
