The first decision to make is about the type of controlling that the company wants to manage: if the goal is to build a system of corporate centers, interconnected by cost/revenue value reversal logics, in order to enhance analytic accounting in all its characteristics, it is necessary to enter the ***Company Table*** and set the controlling management flag (*Controlling*), which is present in the *Other settings* tab.

We will continue the configuration by moving to the *Divisions* grid in the upper right corner, where we will set the frequency to *monthly* (which is the default option) or *weekly*.

Generally, in controlling, we only value the economic movements of costs and revenues; if we want to include the asset, we can set the flag 'Import asset in controlling'.

:::tip Note 
If the company is only interested in managing mid-year accounting balance sheets or a basic configuration of corporate centers that does not involve reversal drivers among them, the *Controlling* management in the company table can be omitted.
