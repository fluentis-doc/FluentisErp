Within each ***Employee***, it is possible to associate the [***COST CENTER***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/cost-centers) of reference, which will be used for importing payroll movements but also within the ***Activities by Project*** of the projects area, in combination with the ***Task Category***.

:::tip Note 
Within the *Activities by Project*, in particular, the source center will be set by the employee/resource's center, while the destination center will be set by the task category.

In this way, cases can be managed where, for example, technical office personnel work for sales, thereby transferring the costs from the belonging center to the destination center of the activities.
