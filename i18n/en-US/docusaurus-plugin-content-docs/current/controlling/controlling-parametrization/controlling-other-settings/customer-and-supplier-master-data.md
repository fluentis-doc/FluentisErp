Within the customer/supplier/agent registers, in the detail of the accounting data, in the **ANALYTIC** tab we can configure which corporate centers to assign the costs/revenues present within the documents or records entered in ***FluentisERP***. The prioritization of valuation will depend on the parameters of the individual usage module.

:::tip Note 
Profit centers are visible for backward compatibility; in companies with *Controlling* active, it is advisable to replace profit centers with a specific dimension to be valued in the corporate centers.
