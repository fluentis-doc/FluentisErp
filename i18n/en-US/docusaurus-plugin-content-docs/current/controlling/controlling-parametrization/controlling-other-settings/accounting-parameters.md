Since we can link Corporate Centers to multiple Fluentis registers, we need to define the priority for valuing them when we are manually recording in accounting (or when performing a booking from a module that does not manage analytics).

Within the accounting parameters, at the bottom right, we find the **PROPOSE COST/PROFIT CENTERS FROM**, with the following options:
- *Accounting Cost*: means reading the configuration of the centers from the detail account of the *Chart of Accounts*
- *Register*: means reading the configuration from the *Customer/Supplier/Agent Register* named in the ledger record being entered
- *Industrial Cost*: not active

Using the *Move Up* and *Move Down* buttons, present in the ribbon, we will arrange the options in the desired order.

The assignment logic is always related to the chart of accounts, and therefore, we recommend prioritizing the ACCOUNT COST.
