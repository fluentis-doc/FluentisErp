Normally, stock records do not provide for automatic valuation of cost centers, although each movement line includes the detail section of cost center valuation: this is because it is usually sufficient to value them when accounting for initial and final inventory in the controlling area.

:::tip note
If you want to automatically value the analytic data during the recording of loads/unloads from documents, you can enable the *Cost Centers* flag in the related warehouse templates.
