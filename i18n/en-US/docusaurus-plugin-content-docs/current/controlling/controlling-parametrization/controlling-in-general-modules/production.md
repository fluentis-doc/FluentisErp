The production procedure, at the time of recording a production report (a progression, for example), based on the machines and/or labor groups and their connections to the centers, will report in the production declaration the link to the relevant center.

:::tip Note 
From the production declarations, we will read the times (machine, man, and tooling for both man and machine) rather than the quantities produced, through the procedure of ***Data Retrieve from Production***.
