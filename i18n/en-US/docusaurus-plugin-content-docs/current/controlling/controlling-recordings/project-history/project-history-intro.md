In this section of ***Managerial Accounting***, we have various items for displaying data processed on the *Projects/Job Orders* dimension.

We have the following items available:

- ***Historical physical job order movements**, to view the details of times (machine/man/rig) related to projects

- ***Management Records***, to see costs and revenues directly attributed to the project/job order from the mid-year closing

- ***Production values***, to see the costs of materials and processes charged to the project/job order

- ***Project consolidation***, to see the result of the processing of the project budget, which will include direct and indirect costs allocated through Cost drivers of the project dimension.
