In this interface, we can visualize the costs of materials related to projects/job orders, both those processed internally and externally.

The available fields are as follows:

- the ***Detail account***, which will typically be the Purchase Revenue linked to the item rather than the account of external processing

- the [***Corporate Center***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/cost-centers) linked to the line, which typically comes from the setting in the chart of accounts for the previous detail account

- the ***Year*** and the ***Date Range***

- ***Project Number***, ***Project Year***, ***Row***, ***WBS Number***: these will always be populated by references to projects

- ***Item*** and ***Item Description*** are the data of the item in motion

- the [***Unit of Measure***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/measure-units) of the movement

- the ***Quantity*** of the movement

- the ***Average Cost***, or ***Standard Cost*** or ***Latest Cost*** for the line

Deleting or modification, as well as data input in the grid, is not allowed.
