In the ***Historical Physical Job Order Movements***, we have visibility of the production quantities linked to projects/job orders. In particular, we have:

- [***Area***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/area-types-areas)

- ***Year*** and ***Date Range***

- ***Reference Project***

- [***Corporate Center***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/cost-centers) of the movement

- ***Class*** and ***Code*** of the produced/worked item

- ***Production Phase*** and ***Subphase***

- [***Unit of Measure***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/measure-units) of the movement

- ***Production Quantity***, that is the expenditure recorded from production declarations

- ***Production cycle Phase Quantity***, that is the quantity compared to the theoretical cycle

- ***Standard Phase Quantity***, that is the quantity compared to the standard phase

- ***Time List*** goes hand in hand with the type of quantity recorded in the previous fields

- ***Source*** indicates the origin of the recorded data, typically *Production*
