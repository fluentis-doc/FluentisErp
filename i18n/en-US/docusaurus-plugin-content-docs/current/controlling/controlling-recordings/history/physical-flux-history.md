From this form, it is possible to query, in view-only mode, the history of management records expressed in non-economic physical quantities.

The grid presents the following fields:
- the [***Area***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/area-types-areas) of analysis

- the [***Origin corporate center***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/cost-centers) of the quantity

- the [***Destination center***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/cost-centers) of the quantity

- the ***Year*** and the ***Date Range*** of reference

- the [***Unit of measure*** ](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/measure-units)

- the ***Quantity***

- in the ***Calculated*** field, we have the visualization of the data source: it will usually be the *Physical Movement Registration*, but it could also be the *Physical Movement Flow*

- the ***Code***, ***Number***, and ***Description*** fields of the reference asset of the line

Deleting, modification, or data insertion in the grid is not allowed.
