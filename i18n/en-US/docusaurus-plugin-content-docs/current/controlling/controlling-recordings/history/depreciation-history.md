The ***Historical Amortization*** mask allows you to view the details, asset by asset, of the processing result of the technical depreciations specific to *Controlling*. In the mask, we have visibility of the following fields:

- The [***Area***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/area-types-areas) of reference

- The [***Corporate Center***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/cost-centers) to which the depreciation is attributed

- The ***Year*** and the ***Date Range*** of reference

- The ***Percentage*** used if the calculation is based on percentage

- The ***Quantity*** of the period, if the calculation is based on quantity

- The ***Value*** of the depreciation

- The ***Cost per unit*** if the calculation is based on quantity

- The ***Deatil account*** used

- References to the ***Number*** and ***Description*** of the asset line

Starting from this detail calculated by the ***Process Periods*** form, ***FluentisERP*** will have created an ***Off-balance Area Registration*** that will present the analytical values from the totals of account/center and date range related to this data source.
