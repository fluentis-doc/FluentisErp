The procedure for ***Update Production Center Rates*** allows you to indicate from which area and periods to calculate the rate to be stored in the rates of [***Production Centers***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/cost-centers). In the event that, therefore, upon analyzing the finals, it has been noticed that the final rates significantly deviate from those that production uses for its produced cost calculations, it will be possible to proceed with an automatic alignment of the data.
