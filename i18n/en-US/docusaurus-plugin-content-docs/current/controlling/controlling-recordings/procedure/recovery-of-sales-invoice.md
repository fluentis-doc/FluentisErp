The procedure ***Data Retrieve from Sales Invoices*** allows us to integrate our data area with two types of data present in sales invoicing: commissions and discounts.

## RETRIEVE COMMISSIONS 
For commissions, the need is to detect in the period the costs of the commissions that accounting will only record at the maturation of the commission, that is, maybe only at the time of the total collection of the invoice. We will set, as always: 
- the [***Area***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/area-types-areas)
- the ***Date*** 
- the ***Year***  
Then on the right side we will enter: 
- the ***Template*** 
- the range ***By Date*** and ***To date*** of invoice dates to filter for data extraction.


## RETRIEVE DISCOUNTS
Discounts, on the other hand, are a value that analytic accounting normally does not find from accounting records, which typically value the net revenue and not the gross minus the cost of the applied discount. In certain analyses, it may be important to highlight this hidden cost that the company bears to sell, hence the elaboration of this data.

We will set, as always: 
- the [***Area***](/docs/controlling/controlling-parametrization/controlling-specific-settings/area-types-areas)
- the ***Account*** on which to record these commercial costs
- the ***Date*** 
- the ***Year***  
Then on the right side we will enter: 
- the ***Template*** 
- the range ***By Date*** and ***To date*** of invoice dates to filter for data extraction.
