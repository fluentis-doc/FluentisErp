Within the Managerial Accounting module, we have all the procedures for data entry and processing of accounting for corporate centers in areas of analysis different from the budget area: we will have the first entry of physical movements or off-balance sheet records for the area, the history of processed data (both physical and valued) for the year/period, various control and data extraction views, and the visualization of the final financial report of the data for the project analysis dimension.

## To get started
We suggest referring to the section of the [*General Overview of Controlling*](/docs/controlling/general-overview-controlling/general-overview) for an overview of the tables and logical steps of the configuration, which should start from a precise analysis of the company's productive structure and the objectives to be achieved by implementing Management Control.

The module is structured into the following sections:
- **Journal entry**: a first entry for data or area analysis registrations
    - *Physical movements record*: valued by production/project or manually
    - *Off-balance records for area*: automatically valued from depreciation or inventory, rather than manually
    - *Standard rates of centers*: manually managed

- **History management**
In this section, we have all the historical data bases processed
    - *Physical flow history*: the historical data base of physical movements
    - *Historical depreciation*: the historical data base of processed depreciations
    - *Historical records management*: the monthly and reprocessed data base from all drivers
    - *Index history*: the historical data base of cost indices processed across various centers

- **Procedures**
In this section, we find various data recovery and processing procedures
    - *Data retrieve from production*: to retrieve times and costs from projects, times from production, costs from internal/external processes
    - *Data retrieve from Sales invoices*: to retrieve commissions and applied discounts
    - *Process periods*: to process physical data, depreciations, and process the data base by applying drivers
    - *Update production rates*: to align the rates of production centers
    - *Master consolidation*: to create a unified group controlling

- **Project history**
In this section, we have all the historical data bases processed for those working on project/job order
    - *Historical physical job order movements*: the historical data base of the times and quantities worked on the project/job order
    - *Management Records*: the historical data base of direct project costs and revenues
    - *Production values*: materials and processes directly used on the project/job order
    - *Job order consolidation*: the resulting data base with direct, indirect costs, and cost allocation driver
