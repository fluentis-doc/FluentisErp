The screen allows you to view the list of accounts that are not used for controlling, as stored during each processing of a new *Mid-Year Closing*. From this screen, if necessary, it will be possible to intervene to align the data of already completed closings on the fly when one realizes the need for a modification of the previously applied logic.
