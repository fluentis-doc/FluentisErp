The grouping parameters allow you to define how to divide documents during fulfillment procedures. For this purpose, it is possible to use specific flags to group documents based on various properties, such as category, document type, or other relevant characteristics.            
These general grouping parameters must be configured only once and will be automatically applied to all procedures, being valid for all customers and suppliers. However, if a customer or supplier requires different behavior from that set in the general parameters, it will be necessary to customize the grouping parameters within their specific registry.           
In this way, flexible and adaptable management of fulfillments is ensured, allowing the specific needs of each customer or supplier to be met, while maintaining a centralized and consistent configuration for most operations.

In this form, the grouping rules for the procedures are decided:  
-  **Creation of NIR from purchase invoice (Creazione NIR da fattura di acquisto)**;  
-  **Creation of NIR from purchase DDT (Creazione NIR da DDT di acquisto)**.  

These procedures are used only in the case of Romanian localization.   

It is necessary to flag the columns that provide for the groupings that you want for these fulfillments. The **Summary** is essential to create a single document with different starting documents. The other flags, on the other hand, relate to specific groupings.
