The parameters of purchase orders allow for basic settings to manage correctly and according to the specific requests of each individual company.

#### Specific Fields 

- **Mandatory evasion**: if active, when entering a new supplier order, the Fulfillment form will open, and it will not be possible to manually add items to the order without having first fulfilled at least one line of a Purchase Job Order.

- **Escaping of obligatory orders**: if active, the insertion of items in Supplier Orders can only be done through Fulfillment from the job order; it will not be possible to add other items to the order, in addition to those entered through fulfillment.

- **Fixed quantity**: when set, the order cannot be fulfilled for a quantity greater than that entered in the order.


#### Specific Button 

> **Refresh**: allows restoring the parameters to their initial values.
