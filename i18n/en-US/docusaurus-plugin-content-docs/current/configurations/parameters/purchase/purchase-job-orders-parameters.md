The parameters of purchase orders allow for basic settings to manage correctly and according to the specific requests of each individual company.

#### Specific Fields 

- **Mandatory evasion**: when set, and the user is on the header of the supplier order and switches to the *Items* tab, the *Fulfillment from order* form automatically opens, thus the user is required to fulfill the open orders for the specified supplier in the order.

- **Escaping of obligatory orders**: when set, and items are entered in the *Items* tab, it checks that the item is present in an order from the selected supplier.

- **Fixed quantity**: when set, the order cannot be fulfilled for a quantity greater than that entered in the order.


#### Specific Button
