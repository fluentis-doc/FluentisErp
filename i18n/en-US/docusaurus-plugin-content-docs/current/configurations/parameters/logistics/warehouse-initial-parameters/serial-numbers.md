In this tab it is possible to set the types of Serial Numbers to be managed in a following step into database. First insert a code and a description of the Serial Number type, save the line and then decide which parameters are necessary to use for the composition of the Serial Number type, just created. Each parameter used can have how many characters the user wants and in case, the user can decide even the leader line to be used. For example, through the 'Progressive Number' parameter, by setting '0' as leader line and '5' as lenght it will be possible to create lots with 00000 as first number, then 00001, then 00002 and so on.

The Serial Number type has then to be connected with the item's register into the specific field on 'Lots/SN' tab. In this way, within procedures for creating the Serial Number of the item in question, the same Serial Number can be generated according to specific rules, which are set on 'Serial Number' tab of warehouse parameters and are connected with the Serial Number type of the item.
