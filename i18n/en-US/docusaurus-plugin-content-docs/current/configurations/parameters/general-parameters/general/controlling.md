**Manage cost centers by department** (code FS-CO-CostCenterByDepartment): with this setting, we can assign to the cost center of *Division* X, movements also referring to *Division* Y. Normally, in fact, ***FluentisERP*** will allow using the *Cost Centers* linked to the same Division as the movement, not to different divisions.
