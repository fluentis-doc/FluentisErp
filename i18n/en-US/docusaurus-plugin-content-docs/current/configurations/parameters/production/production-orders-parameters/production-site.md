The table allows for the management of the coding of different types of *Production Site (Sito di produzione)*.

It enables the insertion of new records or the search for already existing ones to view, modify or delete them.

## Search Production Site (Ricerca Sito Produzione)

The form consists of a filter area and a result area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click on the **Search** button to view the results in the result grid.

## Insert New Production Sites (Inserire nuovi siti di produzione)

To insert a new production site, use the **New** button in the search form.

In the input form, the production site is defined in the upper section using the fields **Code** and **Description**.  

## Modify Production Sites (Modificare i siti di produzione)

To modify production sites, select the site in the search form and double-click the row or use the **Modify** button.

Entering edit mode allows you to view and modify the parameters of the related warehouses for that *Production Site (Sito di produzione)*.      
These are the same as those present in the [Production Order Parameters (Parametri Ordini di Produzione)](/docs/configurations/parameters/production/production-orders-parameters/production-orders-parameters-intro), but they take precedence over the general ones, because if the production site is inserted, they are used by the procedures instead of the general ones.

The **Contact** field in the **Production Site (Sito di Produzione)** is used in [Shipments (Spedizioni)](/docs/logistics/shipping/shippings) to suggest the Address of the loading location when selecting the corresponding production site.  

For anything not detailed in this document regarding the common operation of the forms, please refer to the following link [Common Functions, Buttons, and Fields (Funzionalit√†, pulsanti e campi comuni)](/docs/guide/common).
