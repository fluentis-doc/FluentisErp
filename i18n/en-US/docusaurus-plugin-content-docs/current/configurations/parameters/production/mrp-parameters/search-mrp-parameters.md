This is the search window for the [MRP Parameters](/docs/erp-home/registers/items/create-new-item) of the items present in the database. For each item, the MRP parameters registry is created as soon as its “main” registry is entered by clicking on the **MRP Parameters** button located in the ribbon bar of the *Items register* form.

#### Specific Buttons

> **Edit parameters**: calls the procedure to modify the MRP parameters of a previously entered item. Once the row of the item whose parameters you want to modify is selected, clicking this button will enter the detail window allowing for editing.  
> **View parameters**: calls the procedure to view the MRP parameters of a previously entered item. Once the row of the item for which you want to view the parameters is selected, clicking this button will open the detail screen where only viewing will be possible, and no data modification will be enabled.  
> **Parameters substitution**: opens a window that allows deciding which information related to the item to modify. This button is enabled only when multiple items (more than one) are selected for mass changing of the same information. In the window that opens, all the MRP parameters present in the *General data* tab will appear, allowing you to see how the information is set and modify only the data of interest. It will not be possible to modify the data present in the *Warehouses* tab in a mass manner.
