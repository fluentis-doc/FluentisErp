The table is located along the path **Tables > Quality > Complaints and Non-compliance > Causes**.

In this table, it is possible to encode the *Causes*, both expected and actual, that led to a nonconforming situation.   
Some examples of the use of *Defects Detected* can be found in the management of:
> **Complaints** - in the tabs *Defects Management*, *8D Management > Causes*, and *8D Management > Permanent Actions*;   
> **Non-compliance** - in the *Defects Management* tab.

The table allows for the entry of new records or the search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Causes**

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, it is sufficient to click the **Search** button to display the results in the results grid.
