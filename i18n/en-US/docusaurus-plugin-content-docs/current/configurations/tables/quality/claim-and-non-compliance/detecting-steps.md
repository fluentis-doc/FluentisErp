The table is located at the path **Tables > Quality > Complaints and Non-compliance > Detecting Steps**.

Some examples of using *Detecting Steps* can be found in the management sections:

> **Non-compliance** - in the tab *Defect Management > Defective Data*.

The table allows the insertion of new records or searching for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.
