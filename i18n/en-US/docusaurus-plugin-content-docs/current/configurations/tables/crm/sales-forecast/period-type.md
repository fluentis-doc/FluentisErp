In this table, it is important to provide Fluentis with specifications on the types of periods to be used in Sales Forecasts. In the first grid, it is possible to assign a **Code** and a **Description** unique to each Type, also indicating which Type to propose by default using the designated flag.

For each row of the first grid, it is necessary to complete the second grid to instruct the software on the duration of the various periods. By way of example, in the case of the period type *Yearly* indicated in the first grid, it is necessary to specify in the second grid the duration of each month over the course of a year (for example, January from 01/01 to 31/01, February from 01/02 to 29/02, etc.). In this way, Fluentis will be able to allocate the amounts of the sales forecasts across the different months indicated. For each type present in the first grid, therefore, it is possible to foresee periods of variable duration based on business needs.
