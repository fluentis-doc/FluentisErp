In this table, it is possible to define the various Types of sales forecasts that you want to create. They will have a **Code** and a **Description** along with an associated [Period Type](/docs/configurations/tables/crm/sales-forecast/period-type). In this way, when creating a new Forecast, Fluentis will know the periods in which to divide the forecast itself.
