In this table, it is necessary to define the types of Period to be used in the creation of [Marketing Budgets (Marketing Budget)](/docs/crm/sales-forecast-crm/marketing-budget).     
Each type can be associated with a unique Code and Description. Furthermore, with the relevant flag, it will be necessary to decide for each type whether the budget period should be on an Annual, Semi-annual, Quadrimestral, Quarterly, Monthly, or Weekly basis. 
Based on the selected flag, during the creation of the Budget, the year will be automatically divided into periods and the amounts will be distributed among these periods. For example, if the monthly flag is selected, the budget amount will be divided into 12 months within the relevant table.
