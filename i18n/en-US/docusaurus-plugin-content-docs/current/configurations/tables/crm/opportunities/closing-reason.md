It is a descriptive table for cataloging the **closure reasons (motivazioni di chiusura)** that can be specified in the [Opportunities](/docs/crm/chance/new-chance/) of the CRM. It is common to all companies present in the database and consists of a simple code/description table, along with the Positive/Negative sign of the reason. 
It is composed of a filter section where you can search by the code or description of the closure reason and the sign of the operation (Positive/Negative), and a grid where all the entered reasons will be listed.
