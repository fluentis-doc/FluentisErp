This table is used to configure which Operations are possible for the various [Ticket Types](/docs/configurations/tables/crm/tickets/ticket-type). In the first grid, it is possible to characterize the operations by associating a **Code**, a **Description**, and an **Expiration Date**.        
In the second grid, it is necessary to indicate the ticket types for which the operation selected in the first grid will be available.
