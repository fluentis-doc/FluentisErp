:::tip[Fast Start (FAst Start)]
The table is affected by the [**Fast Start**](/docs/guide/fast-start) procedure.

If manual configuration is intended, refer to the checklist of the linked page.
:::

In this table, precodes are encoded, valid for the individual company or for all, depending on the **Fixed Assets Parameters** set, which will be usable in defining the numbering of asset sheets, if the *precode management (gestione precodici)* flag is activated in the [**Fixed Assets Parameters**](/docs/configurations/parameters/finance/fixed-assets-parameters).

In particular, precode management is useful when it is necessary to obtain a non-unique or unique numbering; otherwise, for example, it is not possible to have two sheets with the number 1. If there are two precodes A and B, then it will be possible to have sheet number 1 related to precode A and number 1 related to precode B.

Another example of use is to group assets by year (thus, the various precodes will correspond to the year of purchase) or by type, etc.


#### Specific Fields (Campi specifici)

**Code**: alphanumeric code of the precode.

**Description**: description of the precode.
