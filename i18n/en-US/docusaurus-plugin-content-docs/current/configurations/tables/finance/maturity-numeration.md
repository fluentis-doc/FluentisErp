:::tip[Fast Start]
The table is affected by the [**Fast Start**](/docs/guide/fast-start) procedure.
:::

Defines the valid numbering for accounting items, which **must** be of an annual type and **without** recovery of any gaps in numbering.

:::tip Attention
During the startup phase of the company, if open items are imported from Excel, it is recommended to enable the number sequence starting from a date prior to the minimum document date, as ***FluentisERP*** will assign the item number based on the document year, and thus the number sequence must be valid to perform the import.
