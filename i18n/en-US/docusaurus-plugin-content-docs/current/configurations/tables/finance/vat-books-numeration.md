title: Numbering registers iva

Allows for setting a number for the VAT protocol for each register with the usual standard options common to other counters present in the management software (except for the alphanumeric management formula: the VAT protocol is **ALWAYS** a number), instead of the standard numbering provided for VAT registers.

The numbering settings are the same as those of other standard counters.

The numbering set in this table is referenced within the [**VAT registers table**](/docs/configurations/tables/finance/vat-books/).

:::tip Note (Nota)
In the Italian reality, it is **not** necessary to define any counter in this table, as the protocol **always** follows the solar year, regardless of the fiscal year spanning or not spanning the solar year itself, and therefore the standard numbering already provided in the VAT Registers table is sufficient for management.
The option has been included for foreign cases where the protocol does not follow the solar year.
