### Table Management (Gestione tabella)

The definition of the account type table is nothing more than a â€˜qualification' that indicates to the procedure how to manage the sub-account code assigned to it:

- first of all, it identifies how to value the management detail of the 4 types of registries provided;

- secondly, it identifies the sections of the balance sheet (assets/liabilities/costs/revenues);

- it can finally serve as a filtering criterion, typically within the account help.

#### Specific Fields (Campi specifici)

**Code**: account type code.

**Description**: account type description.

**A. Active (P. Attivo)**: with flag on active.

**A. Passive (P. Passivo)**: with flag on passive.

**C. Costs (E. Costi)**: with flag on costs.

**C. Revenues (E. Ricavi)**: with flag on revenues.

**O. Order (C. Ordine)**: with flag on order accounts.

**Client**: with flag on customers + active.

**Supplier**: with flag on suppliers + passive.

**Bank**: with flag on active or passive + bank.

**Agent**: with flag on agent + passive.

**Service**: with flag on service. Accounts with this active flag are the sub-accounts for which the procedure automatically manages rectification and integration entries at the level of interim financial statements, as well as adjustments in general accounting.

**Controlling**: Accounts of this type can only be used in the controlling area and not in general accounting entries.

#### Subsequent Flags (from *All* to *Conai Settings*) (Flag successivi (da *Tutti* a *Impostazioni Conai*))**

With these flags, the visibility of the corresponding tabs within the customer/supplier accounting registries is enabled. Activating *All* will make all tabs visible.
