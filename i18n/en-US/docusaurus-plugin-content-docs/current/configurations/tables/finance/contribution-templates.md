The â€˜contribution template' table enables the user to define the social security contribution template in order to link it to the withholding tax types: as already said, the management of that section is no longer necessary.

RIBBON BAR: the ribbon bar represents the Form menu, that is the area in which it is possible to operate on previous recordings or generate new ones. The possible features list is the following:



| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Search | Button to look for a contribution template |
| New | Button to insert a new contribution template |
| Delete | Button to delete a contribution template |
