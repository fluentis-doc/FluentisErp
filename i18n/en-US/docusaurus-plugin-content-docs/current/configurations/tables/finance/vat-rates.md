The label referred above is common to all the companies in the database and has a VAT rates list, that is applicable in the whole management software.

It is a preloaded label on which the user can work in order to edit or add what would be necessary for company activity.

The mask has three sections: the upper one with the VAT rates list; the central section, which defines more purchases/sales detail accounts in order to use them for every ‘VAT accounting type' of the customer/supplier (or with default accounting parameters; its use depends on precise settings of the default ledger template, to which it refers) and in the lower section there is a detail of VAT specific encoded notes, that aren't in standard options of the management software.
