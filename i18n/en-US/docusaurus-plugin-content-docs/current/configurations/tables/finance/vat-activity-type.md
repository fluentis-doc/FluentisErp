In this table, it is possible to define the types of VAT activities carried out by the company (if applicable) and optionally associate a pro-rata of VAT deductibility with each type of activity.

The configured types will in turn be associated with the various [**VAT registers**](/docs/configurations/tables/finance/vat-books).

It is possible to mark the main activity that will group the VAT credits or debts in the prints of periodic VAT settlements.

In the VAT settlement print, the details referring to each individual activity and the final summary will automatically be displayed.

**Code / Description (Codice / Descrizione):** freely configurable to name the type of activity entered (e.g., Production... Real Estate...)

**Pro-rata (Pro-rata):** field to enter the percentage of deductibility (100% full deduction or lower percentages down to 0 if the deduction is limited) the field has the same logic as the general pro-rata definable in the [**accounting parameters**](/docs/configurations/parameters/finance/accounting-parameters) and represents a chance for detail to be set for each individual type of activity.

**Main activity (Attivit√† principale):** flag to be applied to the type of activity carried out primarily (in terms of revenue, see the tax provisions).
