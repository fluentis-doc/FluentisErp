The asset accounting type table is used to override the logic of the accounts associated with asset categories: 

the balance sheet account as well as the amortization and fund accounts will be read from the accounting type associated with the asset instead of its category. 

The goal is not to multiply the category “plants and machinery” N times, for example, if, at the level of the chart of accounts, distinct accounts are desired for “vacuum system” rather than “surveillance system,” etc. 

Therefore, it is possible to create a single asset category (and thus a single amortization rate that follows those provided by the ministerial decree that governs them) and then create accounting types to correspond to the detailed accounts that one wishes to manage.

The detail of the form is presented in an intuitive manner when compared to the table of asset categories.

You will enter a code and description to qualify the accounting type, and then enter the specific accounts for the active balance sheet (upper grid) and for the amortization quota and fund (lower grid) as well as the type of amortization.

At this point, within each asset card, it is possible to call up, through the appropriate combo box, the various types of asset accounting coded previously.
