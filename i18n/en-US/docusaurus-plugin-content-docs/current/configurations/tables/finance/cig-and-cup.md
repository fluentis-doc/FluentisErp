title: Bid Identification Code / Unique Project Code 
sidebar_position: 8
---

The two tables, essentially identical, allow the entry of bid identification codes and project codes to be referenced in the documents of the active cycle.

It is noted that there are two flags in the [**customer vendor**](/docs/erp-home/registers/contacts/create-new-contact/accounting-data/customer-vendors-data/fiscal-information) to make the fields visible in the header of the documents (order, delivery note, invoice).

**Code:** accepts the bid code or project code, which will then be reported in the SDI files, for example.

**Date / Date requested:** accepts the start date of validity of the code.

**Active Code:** allows the code to be activated or deactivated.

**Description:** accepts a detailed description related to the code, in order to identify which bid or project it refers to.

**IBAN:** allows the entry of the IBAN code of the bank account that is typically specifically associated with the bid or project in order to channel the related receipts.

:::tip[Note]
For the correct management of CIG and CUP codes in the electronic invoice layouts, since the related tag is a child of the order data, see [**here**](/docs/finance-area/e-invoice/configuration_einvoice#codici-cig-e-cup-tag-2126-codicecup-e-2127-codicecig).
