sidebar_position: 26
---

The table allows for the definition of types of tax (or off-balance sheet) depreciation in order to provide flexibility in calculating off-balance sheet depreciation for alternative purposes.

:::note Attention
For the *controlling* module, a new specific functionality has been developed (creating a dedicated tab within the asset sheet). 
::: 

The current functionality remains active (also for backward compatibility) in the administration module and may be enriched in the future with additional features useful for tax purposes.

**Type**: identifier code of the objective depreciation type.

**Description**: description of the objective depreciation type.

**Incremental oper.**: management flag as "incremental" also for objective data (refer to the same flag of the asset category).

**Usage days calculation (Calcolo giorni d'uso)**: calculation flag for usage days that will calculate the actual days of asset usage in the year instead of using the entire fiscal year as in normal calculation.

**Perc.** The standard percentage to apply.

**Fixed perc. (Perc. fissa)**: with this flag active, the percentage will be fixed without the possibility of customizing it asset by asset.
