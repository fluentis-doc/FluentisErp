Once all desired filters are set, simply click on the **Search** button in the *Ribbon bar* to display the results within the result grid.

To open the details of a reason, simply select it and double click with the mouse or click the **Modify** button (allows you to enter the details and modify them) or the **View** button (allows you to enter the details and view them but without being able to modify them).

To insert a new reason, click the **New** button.

> **Duplicate the selected template**: allows duplicating the selected reason. Useful for creating a new reason based on one with similar characteristics. A window will open asking for a code to be assigned to the new reason you intend to create, and after confirming, you will be asked to enter the newly created reason to modify some characteristics.
