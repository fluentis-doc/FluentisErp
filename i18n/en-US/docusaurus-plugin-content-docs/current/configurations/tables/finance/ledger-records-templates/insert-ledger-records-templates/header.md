| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Template | An univocal alphanumeric code of 5 prints  |
| Template Description | Template Description |
| Movement Type | The recording movement type is an internal fix table, not available to user modifications, which divides not VAT-templates from the VAT movement typologies |
| Document Type | The table is preloaded but it can be edited/integrated by user. In this particular table the ‘Credit note' and ‘Variation note' are very interesting: as regards to the ‘credit note' the procedure controls that the VAT section is increased with negative amounts (a signs coherence control is made on the accounting of the sales/purchases area credit note; so there could never be lines with positive amounts and at the same time others with negative amount for another detail account). As regards to the ‘variation note' the procedure will activate, always in the VAT recording section, an identification flag of lines concerning the variation notes and a reference date.  |
