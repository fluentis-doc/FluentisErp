title: Asset Numbering

The table allows for defining a standard Fluentis numbering (therefore also equipped with formatted numbers, for example) valid for assets (previously provided with simple numbering) and potentially linkable to asset categories.

If a standard type numbering (as described here) is not set, the classic numbering will be used (the one that does not include options for formatted numbers, etc.).
