The table is directly linked to the combo box included in the [**customer contact**](/docs/erp-home/registers/contacts/create-new-contact/accounting-data/customer-vendors-data/finance).

Its logic is connected to one of the criteria for calculating commissions that can be defined in the [**agent contact**](/docs/erp-home/registers/contacts/create-new-contact/accounting-data/agent-registry/direct-commissions).

For example, agent X receives 4% on customers in the *Retailers (Dettaglianti)* category, and 6% for customers in the *Wholesalers* category.

The table allows for the categorization of categories at will through the code and description to assign them to various customer registries.
