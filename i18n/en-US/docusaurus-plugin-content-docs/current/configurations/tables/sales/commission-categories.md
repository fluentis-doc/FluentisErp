In this form, commission categories are defined, essentially a sort of "extra data" for defining the criteria for reading commission percentages.

It is thus possible to define the business layer object and its property that serves as a reading parameter, and in the lower grid, specify a filter condition for validity.

Example **Object** -> FSSalesOrder  
**Property Path** -> SalesOrderTypeCode (the code of the sales order type)

In the lower grid specify **Value** *OCIT* (example to limit the validity to the coded order type *OCIT*, for example, order for Italy)
