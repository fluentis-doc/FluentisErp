The table opens via the path **Tables > Sales > Sales Price List Types** and is used for coding generic sales price lists that differ from custom sales price lists, which use the customer's detail account as the code.

To insert new records, you need to click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button. The fields to be filled in are:     
- **Code/Description**: code and description of the general price list. The code entered must be unique.
- **Price including VAT**: if active, this flag indicates that the price list will be created with a price including VAT; therefore, its items will not have the Price column but only the Price including VAT column, which will directly show the sum of Price and VAT.
