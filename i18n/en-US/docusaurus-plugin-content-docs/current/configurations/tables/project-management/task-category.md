Also within this form, it is possible to add new types in the grid by clicking on the ![](/img/neutral/common/new-child.png) New Group button or ![](/img/neutral/common/new-brother.png) New Aggregation button; this will add a new row in the grid where the following information can be defined:

**Code**: is the code of the category;

**Description**: contains the description of the category;

**Invoiceable Activity**: this flag makes the activity invoiceable by default;

**Value Added Activity**: this flag marks the activity as a value added activity; this flag is present in all documents in the project area, populated by the activity category and then modifiable by the user. In case of documents generated by a procedure and not entered anew, the value of the flag will be inherited from the previous document from which the new one was generated. It will then be possible to analyze between value-added activities and non value added activities.

**Payroll Code**: code that will be used in the payroll data calculation procedure, configured in the **Payroll Codes** table.

**Corporate Center**: contains the cost center that will be used to aggregate activities, providing management control with information on all activities carried out during the period.
