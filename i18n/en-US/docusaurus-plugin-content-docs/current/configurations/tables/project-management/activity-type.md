The table is accessible from **Tables > Project Management > Activity Types**.  
The table contains the possible types of activities. It consists of a filter section where you can search by code and description, and a grid where all the types of activities will be listed (just click on the ![](/img/neutral/common/search.png) Search button in the ribbon bar to view them).

Also within this form, it is possible to add new types within the grid by clicking on the ![](/img/neutral/common/new.png) New button; this will add a new row within the grid where you can define the following information:

**Code**: this is the code for the activity type;

**Description**: this is the description of the code;

**Invoiceable activity**: this flag indicates whether the activity is invoiceable or not;

**Activity Type**: it is possible to link the type for the CRM activity declaration, with the corresponding description;

**Recompute Project**: indicates whether to recompute the project's progress;

There are also a series of flags that indicate, if flagged, the mandatory nature of certain fields in the selected activity type.

**Color**: color to identify activity declarations in the project area calendars, such as the [Planner](/docs/project-management/planned-interventions/planner) and [WBS Resource Allocation](/docs/project-management/planned-interventions/wbs-resource-assignation).
