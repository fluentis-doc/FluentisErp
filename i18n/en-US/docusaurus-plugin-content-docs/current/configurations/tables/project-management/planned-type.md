The table is accessible from **Tables > Project Management > Planned Type**.  
The table contains the possible types of planning. It consists of a filter section where you can search by code and description, and a grid where all planned types will be listed (just click the ![](/img/neutral/common/search.png) Search button in the ribbon bar to view them).

Also within this form, it is possible to add new types within the grid by clicking the ![](/img/neutral/common/new.png) New button: this way, a new row will be added to the grid where the following information can be defined:

**Code**: this is the code of the planned type;

**Description**: this is the description of the code;

**Not planned**: if checked, it indicates that we are dealing with an unplanned type;

**Numeration**: indicates the associated numeration;

**Intervention Type**: indicates the default associated intervention type, along with the relevant description;

**External/Internal**: if checked, indicates that it is an external operation.

**Color**: color to identify planned interventions in the project area calendars, such as the [Planner](/docs/project-management/planned-interventions/planner) and [WBS Resource Allocation](/docs/project-management/planned-interventions/wbs-resource-assignation).
