:::tip Note 
The table is of interest only in companies with the *Controlling* flag active.
:::

In this table, we define the types of **Areas** of analysis, which we distinguish into 3 types:
- the *budget type*, with the corresponding flag set
- the *general rule set type*, with the corresponding flag set
- the third type is one that is neither of these two, without any flags set

It is mandatory to define an area of type **Rule Set** and a generic area to be populated with the **Finals** data of the period. 
Defining an area of type **Budget** is optional, if the company is interested in entering a budget for the cost center.
