:::tip Note
The table is of interest only in companies with the *Controlling* flag active.
:::

In this table, we define the types of **Areas** of analysis, which we distinguish into 3 types:
- the *budget type*, with the corresponding flag set  
- the *general rules set type*, with the corresponding flag set  
- the third type is one that is neither of the previous two, without any flags set

It is mandatory to define an area of type **Rules Set** and a generic area to be filled with the **Period Actuals** data. Defining an area of type **Budget** is optional, if the company is interested in inserting a Budget for the cost center.
