In this table, the policy for definitive and provisional ledger records is defined through a **[*Standard Numeration of Fluentis*](/docs/configurations/tables/fluentis-numerations)**.

**<u>It is recommended to follow the settings visible in the images</u>** for optimal management of numeration.  
It is possible to choose a different periodicity, for example, annual, or not adopt the recovery of free numbers, or even bind the numeration to the consistency criterion between date and number (for example, I cannot have number 2 today and number 1 tomorrow).

It is also possible, in particular cases or specific need, to start numeration from a number other than 1.

**NOTE:** for provisional numeration, it is necessary for the numeration to be negative.
