The form can be found along the path: **Tables > Controlling > Analytical Accounting > Measure units of corporate centers for controlling (Tabelle > Controlling > Contabilità analitica > Unità di misura dei centri aziendali per il controlling)**

In this table, we can specify, for example, that in the ANALYSIS area *FINAL* (AREA DI ANALISI *CONSUNTIVO*), the machinery *X* reads production data for direct costs and job costs based on the specified unit of measure for each business center regarding:

- THE SETUP TIME (IL TEMPO DI RI-ATTREZZAGGIO)
- MAN TIME (IL TEMPO UOMO)
- MACHINE TIME (IL TEMPO MACCHINA)

The three measures are not all mandatory, but depending on the center, one, two, or three dimensions will be valued.

There is also an indication of the validity of the rule.

For a different analysis area, such as *BUDGET* (BUDGET), it is possible to reason with other rules and other validity dates.
