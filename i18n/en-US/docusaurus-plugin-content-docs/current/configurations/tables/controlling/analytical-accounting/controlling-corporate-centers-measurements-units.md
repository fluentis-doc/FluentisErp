In this table, we can specify, for example, that in the *FINAL* ANALYSIS area, machine *X* reads production data for direct costs and job order costs based on the specified unit of measure for each corporate center, regarding:

-	RE-RIG TIME 
-	MANPOWER TIMING 
-	MACHINE TIME 


The three measures are not all mandatory, but depending on the center, one, two, or three dimensions will be valued.

There is also an indication of the validity of the rule.

For a different analysis area, such as *BUDGET*, it is possible to work with other rules and different validity dates.
