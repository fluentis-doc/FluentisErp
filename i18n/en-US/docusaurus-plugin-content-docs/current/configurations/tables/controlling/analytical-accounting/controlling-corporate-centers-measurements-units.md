The form can be found along the path: **Tables > Controlling > Analytical Accounting > Measure units of corporate centers for controlling**

In this table, we can specify, for example, that in the ANALYSIS area *FINAL*, the machinery *X* reads production data for direct costs and job costs based on the specified unit of measure for each business center regarding:

- THE SETUP TIME 
- MAN TIME 
- MACHINE TIME 

The three measures are not all mandatory, but depending on the center, one, two, or three dimensions will be valued.

There is also an indication of the validity of the rule.

For a different analysis area, such as *BUDGET*, it is possible to reason with other rules and other validity dates.
