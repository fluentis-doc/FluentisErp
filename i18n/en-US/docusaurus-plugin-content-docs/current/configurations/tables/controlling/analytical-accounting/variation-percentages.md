In this table, it is possible to code categories of percentage changes to be used in various controlling procedures, such as the preparation of the forecast budget based on the actuals of the previous year, applying increases or decreases, especially when duplicating the **Historical records management***.

In the **[chart of accounts](/docs/erp-home/registers/accounting/analytic-chart-of-accounts)**, for each sub-account, the corresponding entry for the automatic change will be assigned, and when the procedure that copies from one analysis area to another (e.g., from *Final* to *Budget*) is used. You can instruct the system to “apply or not apply these percentages.”

#### Specific Fields (Campi specifici)   
- **Code***  
- **Description***  
- ***FIXED QUOTA (QUOTA FISSA)*** is the percentage of change, positive or negative, to be applied to the fixed quota  
- ***VARIABLE QUOTA (QUOTA VARIABILE)*** is the percentage of change, positive or negative, to be applied to the variable quota

:::tip Insight (Approfondimento)
EXAMPLE: for fixed costs year after year, I establish an increase of 5%, for semi-variable costs, the increase will be 3% for the variable quota and 3% for the fixed quota, and finally, for variable costs, the increase will be 10%. 

The allocation between variable and fixed costs in management control comes from the methodology of "splitting" all costs and all revenues recorded in general accounting into fixed quota and variable quota. It is then carried into *management* accounting “monthly” and divided into fixed quota and variable quota.
