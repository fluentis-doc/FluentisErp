:::tip Note 
This table is for the exclusive use of companies that have set up *Controlling*.
:::


In this table you can codify categories of percentage changes to be used in various controlling procedures, such as processing the forecast budget based on the previous year's actuals, applying increases or decreases, particularly when duplicating the ***Historical Records Management***. 
The table simply includes the following fields:


In the **[Chart of Accounts](/docs/erp-home/registers/accounting/analytic-chart-of-accounts)**, a corresponding entry will be assigned for each detail account for automatic variation, 
and when the procedure that copies from one analysis area to another (e.g., from *Final* to *Budget*) is used. You can tell the system "apply or not apply these percentages".

:::note Table Fields 

- ***CODE***
- ***DESCRIPTION***
- ***FIXED VALUE*** is the percentage of variation, positive or negative, to apply to the fixed value
- ***VARIABLE VALUE*** is the percentage of variation, positive or negative, to apply to the variable value

:::tip Insight 
EXAMPLE: for fixed costs, I establish increases of 5% year over year, for semi-variable costs, the increase will be 3% for the variable value and 3% for the fixed value, and finally, for variable costs, the increase will be 10%.

The allocation between variable and fixed costs in management control comes from the methodology of "splitting" all costs and all revenues recorded in general ledger into fixed and variable values. It is then brought into *management* accounting "monthly" and divided into fixed value and variable value.
