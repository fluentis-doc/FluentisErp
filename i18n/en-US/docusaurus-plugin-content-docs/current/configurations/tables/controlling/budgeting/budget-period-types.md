The mask consists of more grids: budget periods definition can be performed in the first grid on the left, where it is possible to assign code, description and a flag for multiyear management of the same budget period. Once having saved code, it will be possible to insert details of periods on the right grid: in case that the period is multiyear it will be possible to view even the reference year as well as day/month.

This details setting can be defined in two different ways: the first one gives the possibility to set, as start date of all periods, the first day on January, while the second one will correspond to the 'last' day of the related month. The percentage, to be set, will correspond always to a value increase of the previous period and the last period will have 100% of yearly value (e.g. for a quarterly period it will be possible to have 4 periods with 25/50/75/100%). This setting is recommended aboveall not only for economic budget but also for budget based on balance detail accounts, that have to be recorded month by month.

The second setting type loads period and in that case every period will have a general specific percentage. Percentages loaded in this point pertain to standard percentage to be automatically used during data loading, but the user will go on in order to force values according to the necessity.

Under this basic setting there is a list of alternative periods: after having selected the higher 'father' period, it will be possible to establish other N alternative periods to be associated to specific detail accounts of chart of accounts, in order to predetermine specific percentages to be used in particular cases: their detail will be proposed with the same percentages of start period, but the user will have the possibility to edit them freely.
