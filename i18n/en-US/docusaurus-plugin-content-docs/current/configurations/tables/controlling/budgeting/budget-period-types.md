The screen consists of several grids: the definition of **budget periods** is made in the first grid on the left, where a 'code', a 'description', and a flag for the management of 'multi-year' periods are assigned. Once the code is saved, it will activate the possibility to enter the details of the periods in the grid on the right: if the period is multi-year, the reference year will also be displayed, not just the day/month.

The setting of these details can be defined in two ways: the first, recommended, assumes that the starting date of all periods is always set to the first day of January, while the end of each period will be the â€˜last' day of the relevant month. The percentage to be set will therefore always be an incremental value of the previous period and the last period will have 100% of the annual value (for example, for a quarterly period we will have 4 periods with 25/50/75/100%). This setting is especially recommended for budgets that are not only economic but also based on asset sub-accounts, which have an initial balance recovery to report from month to month.

The second type of setting, on the other hand, involves loading separate periods, in which case each will have its specific general percentage. The percentages loaded at this point are standard percentages to be used as defaults during data loading, but the user can override the values case by case as needed.

Below this basic setting, there is a list of alternative periods: after selecting the higher 'parent' period, it will be possible to define N other alternative periods to associate with specific sub-accounts of the chart of accounts, in order to predefine the specific percentages to use in certain cases: the details of these will be proposed with the same percentages as the starting period, but the user is free to modify them as desired.
