The table allows for the definition of the structure, even at different levels, and characteristics of profit centers.

The general section presents the branched structure of the Profit Centres defined for the active company: in red are shown the profit centers that are not assignable in accounting, in bold those usable in production.

**Profit center**: alphanumeric code of the profit center.

**Description**: description of the profit center.


**Cost Driver**: assigns a cost driver of percentage reallocation to the cost center in the Interannual Closures.

**Profit center type**: defines whether the cost center is direct or indirect.

**Responsibility center**: links the cost center to the corresponding responsibility center.

**Start date**: defines the start date of the profit center.

**End date**: defines the end date of the profit center's use.

**Valuable Flag (Flag valorizzabile)**: when this flag is set, the profit center can be valued with accounting movements. Remove the flag from the structure levels that you do not want to value incorrectly and leave it only at the lowest level.

**MRP Flag (Flag MRP)**: this flag allows the use of the profit center in the production module.

:::tip Note (Nota)
the table is to be considered obsolete and is managed only for backward compatibility. It is recommended to rather define a *revenue dimension (dimensione ricavi)* to be used in *Corporate centers*.
