title: Analytic Records Types
sidebar_position: 1
---

The table consists of record type code, description and two flags that characterize the typology. The possible options are:

1) No flag set: the analytic templates that have this setting enable the user to perform analytic records and (if established in value) of cost accounting (CC/PC/job orders)

2) “General Ledger” flag: the analytic templates that have this setting enable the user to associate a general ledger template in order to work on both levels at the same time (and even the analytic ones defined on the same anlaytic or general template)

“Only Analytic” flag: the analytic templates, that have this setting, are templates by value with handling of analytic accounting section (CC/PC/job orders) without having associated cost and general accounting movement.
