The table is located in the path **Tables > Logistics > Management Area** and allows you to manage the coding of different *Management Areas*.

It enables the insertion of new records or the search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

An example of the use of the *Management Area* can be found in the [Cost Calculation](/docs/controlling/cost-calculation/cost/) or in the [Bill of Materials Valorization](/docs/erp-home/registers/production/bill-of-materials/assemblies-valorization/), where it is possible to perform a *Valorization from management area*.

**Insert Management Area**

The table consists of two grids: in the first, you enter **Code** and **Description**; in the second, you can enter a series of data for each *Management Area* such as *Fiscal Category* or *Cost Type*. The table [Cost Type](/docs/configurations/tables/logistics/cost-type/) can in turn contain various types of costs.

To insert new codings in the upper grid, you need to click on the first empty row or press the **New** button.

To insert new codings in the lower grid, you must first select the management area in the upper grid and then enter the required data in the first empty row.
