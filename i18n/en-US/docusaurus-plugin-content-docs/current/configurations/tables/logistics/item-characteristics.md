The *Item Features* input table is necessary to enable the grouping of items. For statistical purposes, it is essential to group items in order to search them based on a parameter.

The table allows for the entry of new records or the search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Item Features**

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results within the results grid.

**Insert Item Features**

To enter new codes, you must click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button.

For the new record, you must enter at least the mandatory fields required by the program: the **Code** alphanumeric character of the feature and its **Description**.

For each feature, you can enter the **Descriptions in language** in the lower grid.
