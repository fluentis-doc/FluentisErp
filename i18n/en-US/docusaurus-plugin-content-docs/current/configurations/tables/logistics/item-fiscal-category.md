The table is located at **Tables > Logistics > Item Fiscal Category**.  

In this table, it is possible to encode the different categories according to the fiscal logic that can then be associated with the product and used as grouping, as statistical data, or as functionality in the relevant modules.  

An example of use can be found within the [Item Registry](/docs/erp-home/registers/items/create-new-item) under the entry *Fiscal Category*.  

The table allows for the insertion of new records or the search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Item Fiscal Category**

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results in the results grid.

**Insert Item Fiscal Category**

To insert new codes, it is necessary to click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button.  

The form is composed of two grids: in the left grid, various *Fiscal Categories* can be coded by entering the **Code** and **Description**.  

In the right grid, it is possible to set the accounts for each category that will be used for the automated processing of final inventory entries.
