The table is located at **Tables > Logistics > Material Types**.

In this table, it is possible to manage the coding of the various *Material Types* of packaging used in [Recycle Management](/docs/sales/sales-flow/conai).

It allows you to insert new records or search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Material Types**

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results in the results grid.

**Insert Material Types**

To insert new codings, you need to click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button.  

In the upper grid, the *Material Types* are coded. The mandatory fields required by the program are **Code** and **Description**.  

*Specific fields*: 

> **Recycle material code**: alphanumeric code indicating the type of material that makes up the packaging (i.e., Steel, Aluminum, Paper, Wood, Plastic, etc.);     
> **Item classes**: indicates the [Class](/docs/configurations/tables/logistics/item-class) to which the item belongs;   
> **Item for recycle fee**: indicates a fictitious item code to be used for inserting the *Recycle Expense* line in the bill/invoice (if no item code is indicated, the material will not be valid for Recycle configuration in sales/purchase items);   
> **Item description**: indicates the description of the *Item for recycle fee*;    
> **Notes**: free annotations.  

In the lower grid, you can define the *Recycle Costs* associated with each material entered in the upper table, that is, the rates to be applied within the various *date ranges*, with the **Unit of measure** to apply: this must be consistent with the unit of measure that will be used within the sales items and the fictitious Conai items.
