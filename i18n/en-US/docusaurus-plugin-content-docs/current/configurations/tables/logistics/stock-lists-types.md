The table allows for the management of the coding of different types of *Stock Lists*.

It enables the insertion of new records or the search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Stock Lists Types**

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all the desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to view the results within the results grid.

**Insert Stock Lists Types**

To insert new codes, it is necessary to click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button.

The **Maintain location** flag in the *Stock Lists Types* table, if active, ensures that during inventory with the **WMS**, the entered location will not change until another location is read; if deactivated, the location must be entered each time before confirming the item.
