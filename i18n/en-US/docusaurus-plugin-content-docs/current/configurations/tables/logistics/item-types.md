The table is located at **Tables > Logistics > Item Type**.

In this table, it is possible to manage the encoding of different *Item Types* to be associated with individual items in the [Generality](/docs/erp-home/registers/items/create-new-items/item-registry/generality) tab.    

It allows for the insertion of new records or the search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Item Type**

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters have been set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results within the results grid.

**Insert Item Type**

To insert new encodings, you must click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button.   
For the new record, it is sufficient to enter the **Description**, optionally associating a **Description in language**, which is the translation of the *Item Type* into another language.   

For anything not detailed in this document regarding the common functionality of the forms, please refer to the following link [Custom features, Buttons, and Fields](/docs/guide/common).
