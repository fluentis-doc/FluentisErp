The Loading Unit types entry table is a base table for the use of loading units. Specifically, it defines the packaging types and related data that will be used for creating and optimizing loading plans (such as weights and dimensions).

The table allows for the insertion of new records or the search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Loading Unit Types**

The form is composed of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to view the results in the results grid.

**Insert Loading Unit Types**

To insert new codes, you need to click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button.

For the new record, you must enter at least the mandatory fields required by the program: Type, Description, Group Type (proposed by the *Loading Unit Group Types* table), Numeration.
