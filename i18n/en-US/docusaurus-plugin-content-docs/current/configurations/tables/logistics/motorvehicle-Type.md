The table can be found at the path **Tables > Logistics > Motorvehicle Types**.

In this table, it is possible to code the *Motorvehicle Types* that can be selected in the [Motorvehicle Registry](/docs/logistics/motorvehicles/motorvehicle).

The table allows you to insert new records or search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Motorvehicle Types**

The form consists of a filter area and a result area. Once all the desired filters have been set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results within the result grid.

**Insert Motorvehicle Types**

To insert new ones, you need to click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button.       
For the new record, at least the required mandatory fields must be filled in: **Code** and **Description**.        
With the **Cancel** button, you can remove the selected record.
