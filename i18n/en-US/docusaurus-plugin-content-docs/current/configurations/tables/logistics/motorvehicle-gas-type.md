The table is located on the path **Tables > Logistics > Motorvehicle Gas Types**.

In this table, it is possible to code the *Motorvehicle Gas Types* that can be selected in the [Motorvehicle Registry](/docs/logistics/motorvehicles/motorvehicle).

The table allows for inserting new records or searching for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Motorvehicle Gas Types**

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to view the results within the results grid.

**Insert Motorvehicle Gas Types**

To insert new entries, you need to click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button.     
For the new record, only one mandatory field is required by the program: **Description**.         
Additionally, for each type, it is possible to indicate whether it is:
- **CNG fuel**
- **Diesel fuel**
- **Hybrid fuel**
- **Electric**
- **GPL fuel**
- **Organic fuel**
- **Petrol**
- **Hybrid/Petrol fuel** 
by simply activating the corresponding flag.  
These flags are used to identify the type of fuel used by the vehicle for ESG purposes.

With the **Cancel** button, you can delete the selected record.
