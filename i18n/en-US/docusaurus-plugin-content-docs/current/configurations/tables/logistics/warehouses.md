:::important What it is for
The Warehouses table in Fluentis allows for the creation, modification, and management of warehouse records, ensuring effective material handling within the system. 
In the table, users find an intuitive interface that includes search tools and filters for quick data accessibility. It is possible to enter new warehouses specifying at least the code and the description, along with details such as the management area and the expiration date.      
Each warehouse can be assigned to a specific production site, thus facilitating resource organization and inventory monitoring.     
Linking each warehouse to a particular production site represents an added value, as it allows for optimizing resource distribution and improving corporate logistics planning.

The table is located at **Tables > Logistics > Warehouses**.

The warehouse entry table is necessary to correctly utilize all system functions that involve material handling.

The table allows for the entry of new records or the search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Warehouse**

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to view the results in the results grid.

**Insert Warehouse**

To enter new codes, you need to click in the grid on the first empty row or press the **Insert** button. 
For the new record, at least the mandatory fields required by the program must be entered: the Code of the **Warehouse** and the **Description**.

*Specific fields*: 

> **Production site**: indicates the [Production Site](/docs/configurations/parameters/production/production-orders-parameters/production-site) to which the warehouse belongs;   
> **Management area**: indicates the [Management Area](/docs/configurations/tables/logistics/management-area) to which the warehouse belongs;     
> **End validity date**: indicates the expiration date of the warehouse;  
> **Code name** and **Company name**: indicate the destination (taken from the *Register Printing*).   

For each warehouse, it is then possible to enter the related **Cost Centers** and/or **Revenue Centers**.
