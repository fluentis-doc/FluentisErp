FILTER AREA: The filter area contains the list of the possible data types thanks to which it is possible to perform a selection. In this case the search filter works according to warehouse description.

RESULT GRID: the result grid represents the warehouses list which correspond to the filter data, above mentioned. After having specified the values through which it is possible to perform a warehouses search, the user can push [Search] button on the related Ribbon and will obtain the list of the desired wareouses.

Apart from searching warehouses on system it is possible even to add one or more warehouses. In order to do this, it is necessary to click on the first free record (or to push the [insertion] button on toolbar). In this way it is possible to indicate warehouse code and description. Possibly it is possible to indicate production site, management area, end validity date of warehouse, destination (taken from contacts register) and/or point of sale.

For each warehouse it is possible even to insert the related cost and/or profit centres.
