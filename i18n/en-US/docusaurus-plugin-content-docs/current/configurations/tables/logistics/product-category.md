The table can be found at the path **Tables > Logistics > Item Product Category**.

This table manages the coding of the various categories according to the product logic, which can then be associated with the product to be used as grouping, statistical data, or functionality in the respective modules.

An example of usage can be found within the [Item Registry](/docs/erp-home/registers/items/create-new-item) under the item *Product Category*.

The table allows for the insertion of new records or to search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Item Product Category**

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results in the results grid.

**Insert Item Product Category**

To insert new codings, you need to click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button.

For the new record, at least the mandatory fields required by the program must be filled in: an alphanumeric **Code** and its **Description**.

In the lower grid, you can enter the **Descriptions in Language** for each *Product Category*.
