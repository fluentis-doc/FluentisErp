The table is located at **Tables > Logistics > Material Profiles**.  

In this table, it is possible to code the different *Material Profiles* to associate with individual items.  
An example of usage can be found within the Item Registry in the [Weights/Dimensions](/docs/erp-home/registers/items/create-new-item) tab under the *Profile* entry.  

It allows you to insert new records or search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Material Profiles**

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click on the **Search** button to display the results within the results grid.

**Insert Material Profiles**

To insert new *Material Profiles*, you need to click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button.   
For the new record, at least the mandatory fields required by the program must be filled in: **Code** and **Description**.

*Specific fields*: 

> **Code**: this is the code for the *Material Profile*.   
> **Description**: this is the description of the *Material Profile*.     
> **Notes**: free annotations.
