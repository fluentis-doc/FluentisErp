The table opens via the path **Tables > Purchases > Purchase Price List Types** and is used to indicate the different types of purchase price lists.

It allows for the insertion of new records or the search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results within the results grid.

To insert new codes, you need to click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button. 

**Code/Description**: mandatory fields to define the type of price list.
