By opening this table, you access the search mask for the main configurations that have been previously coded and serve as a starting point for creating new ones.        
When opening a configuration, the header data and three underlying tabs are present. 

## Header (Testata)

The header presents the following fields:
- **Configuration type**: here you indicate the [type]( /docs/configurations/tables/CPQ/configuration-type) of configuration. 
- **Code**: a unique code is assigned, which can be modified.
- **Version**: a version number is assigned to the configuration, starting from 1.
- **Description**: it is possible to associate a free description.
- **Start/End Validity Date (Data inizio/fine validit√†)**: it is possible to associate a validity range for the configuration.
