The table is compiled by entering a code and a user description, to which a reference numerator, a type of effect from the predefined ones, and finally a detail account for movement must be assigned: this detail account will be used in counterpart to the customer closure within the bills accounting procedure.

The type of bill can then be associated with the type of payment in the corresponding table.

Finally, it is noteworthy that only bills of exchange type can be managed in the unpaid accounting procedure on the Unpaid module disposal.

The flag **Manage Partial Amount** allows creating bills that partially consume the items, indicating the amount. It requires manual management within the bill.

The link **Counter** is not used for the Italian localization; it is used for registering bills from cash registers.
