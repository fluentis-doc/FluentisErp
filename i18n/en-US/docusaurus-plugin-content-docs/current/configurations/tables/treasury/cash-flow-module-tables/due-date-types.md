In this table, the types of off-balance due dates that will be managed manually within the cash flow are defined. Each type can be associated with a bank detail account for directing the flow.

The types coded here represent, more than anything else, a grouping or a label for the actual insertion of the details that is done through the form [**Off-Balance Due Dates**](/docs/treasury/cash-flow/off-balance-due-dates).
