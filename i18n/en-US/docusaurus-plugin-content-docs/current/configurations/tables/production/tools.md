Within this table, all tools that can be invoked within the work cycles in the corresponding *Tools* tab are coded.

The table allows inserting new records or searching for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Tools**

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results in the results grid.

**Insert Tools**

To insert new codes, you need to click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button.

For the new record, at least the mandatory fields required by the program must be filled in: the **Code** and the **Description**. If the **Status** field is selected, it means that the tool is usable.
