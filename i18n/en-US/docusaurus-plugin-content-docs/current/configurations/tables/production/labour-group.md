In this table, all labour groups that will be used in the various phases of work cycles are coded.

The table allows for the insertion of new records or the search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Labour Groups**

The form consists of a filtering area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, just click the **Search** button to display the results in the results grid.

**Insert Labour Groups**

To insert new codes, it is necessary to click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button.

For the new record, in the upper grid, you must enter at least the mandatory fields required by the program: the **Code** of the labour group and its **Description**.         
Furthermore, it is possible to associate each **labour group** with a [cost center](/docs/configurations/tables/production/cost-center).

In the lower grid, for each **labour group**, you can specify the various **Users** that are part of it, indicating the respective [cost center](/docs/configurations/tables/production/cost-center) for each one.
