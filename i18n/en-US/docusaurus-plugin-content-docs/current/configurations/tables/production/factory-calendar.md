Factory Calendar window can be opened through the following path Home > Tables > Production > Factory Calendar. Through this window it is possible to generate and/or edit the company Factory Calendar, that is the most important element that is considered by the General Schedule and MRP procedures.

The window is a table that includes as many boxes as the days of the month selected on the top right side, in the section in which the user can decide the day and the month of the year.

In every box there is a flag that, if active, indicates that the day considered is “Holiday”.  While generating Productive Capacity Calendar, the application automatically generates the availability of the Productive Resource only for the working days of the Factory Calendar. In addition the indication related to the “Holiday” is important even while determing the procurement time of the Preferential Vendors that have to be indicated considering the factory Calendar;  for example, if Saturday and Sunday are set as holiday, by setting as procurement time 10 days, the system considers 2 weeks as the actual procurement time because the working week includes “only” 5 days.

The flags that indicates the holiday can be manually set by the user, or, as usually happens, by using the ribbon button called “Factory Calendar Generation” . By selecting this button, a pop-up window called “Calendar Generation” appears.
