In this table, all the machines used within the various work cycles are coded, each linked to a cost center.

The tables related to machines and labour groups are important for defining the cost of the various phases, as the hourly cost of the machine X machine time added to the hourly cost of the labour group X the hourly worker cost will yield the cost of the processing phase.

The table allows for the insertion of new records or the search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.
