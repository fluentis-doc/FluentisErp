The table can be found at the path **Tables > Production > F.C.S. Tables > F.C.S. Resources**.

The data present in this table is used solely in the procedure for [F.C.S. Scheduling](/docs/planning/ms-master-scheduling/fcs-scheduling).

This form allows for the management of production resources to be scheduled at finite capacity, whose type is associated with the processing phases. For each phase, the type of resource needed and the related quantity are indicated; the identifier of the individual resource is not specified.         
For example, if a tool is needed, I will indicate on the phase what type of tool is required. There may be only one or more than one of that type of tool. Each of them will be defined and managed through this form.
