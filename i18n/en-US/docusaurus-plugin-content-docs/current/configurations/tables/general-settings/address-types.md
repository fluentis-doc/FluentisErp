The table opens via the path **Tables > General Settings > Address types** and is used to freely code (in terms of code and description) a series of alternative addresses to be associated with the contact registry (be it Supplier, Customer, Bank, or Agent).

It allows you to insert new records or search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results within the results grid.

To insert records, you need to click on the first empty row of the grid or press the **New** button.

There are a series of predefined flags that assign a characteristic usable in further automations (some already provided in the standard version) present in the program.

The automations that are already present and ready to use are:

**Email Invoice**: by associating this flag with the type of address you are coding and entering that address in the contact registry under the **Alternative address** section, the email address (or addresses) entered in the appropriate field will be used in the Workflow (status change) for the automatic mass sending of sales invoices.

**Joint holders**: by associating this flag, the suitable address type is coded to define the personal data (related to each co-owner entered in the registry) so that they can later be recalled in the sales invoice.

Other possible flags related to email sending can be associated with the specific document after *Configuration*.

Finally, there are other flags that can be managed for potential fiscal-type automations (Permanent establishment and Tax representative) and the residual Generic office.
