Within this table, all *Pictograms* are coded, which can then be referenced within the related tab of the [Item Registry](/docs/erp-home/registers/items/create-new-item).

The table allows for the insertion of new records or the search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Pictograms**

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to view the results within the results grid.

**Insert Pictograms**

To insert new codes, you need to click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button. 

For the new record, at least the mandatory field required by the program must be filled in: the **Code**.      
For each record, you can enter: a description, the category by selecting it from those coded within the [Pictograms table](/docs/configurations/tables/general-settings/pictograms), any optional notes, and the image of the pictogram itself. 

For everything that is not detailed in this document regarding the common functionality of the forms, refer to the following link [Common functionalities, buttons, and fields](/docs/guide/common).
