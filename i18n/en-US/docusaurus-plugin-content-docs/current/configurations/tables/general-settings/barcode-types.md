The table opens via the path **Tables > General Settings > Barcode types** and allows for the encoding of different item classes and the grouping of items.

It allows you to insert new records or search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results within the results grid.

To insert new records, you need to click in the upper grid on the first empty row or press the **New** button.

**Specific Fields**

**Export public administration**: by activating this flag, a [tag](https://docs.fluentis.com/FluentisErp/docs/finance-area/e-invoice/configuration_einvoice#codifica-articolo-per-cliente--tag-2213-codicearticolo) is created for the management of the barcode in the XML trace of the electronic invoice.           
Additionally, if the uniqueness check of the entered barcode is active, it is done only at the individual item level, while if the flag is deactivated, the uniqueness check of the barcode is performed globally, thus for all items.
