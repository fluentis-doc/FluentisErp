:::tip[Fast Start]
The table is affected by the [**Fast Start**](/docs/guide/fast-start) procedure.

If you intend to configure manually, refer to the checklist on the linked page.
:::

The table can be accessed through the path **Tables > General Settings > Document Types (Tabelle > Impostazioni generali > Tipi documenti)** and holds the possible types of documents that will be stored in the database and managed by the Fluentis Document Management System.

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results within the results grid.

:::note Note
Generally, the table is pre-filled by the installation procedures and the creation of default parameters of the program, therefore its management is limited to the possible creation of particular types to associate documents for archiving.

However, in case of anomalies or error messages during the document export phase (mainly managed by the Bizlink component), it may be necessary to verify the presence of the correct document type that is called by the export algorithms.
:::

It allows for adding new records or searching for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

To insert a new document type, press the **New** button on the ribbon bar.
