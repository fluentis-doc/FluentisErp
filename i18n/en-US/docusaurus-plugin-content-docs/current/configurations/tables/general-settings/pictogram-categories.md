Within this table, all the **Pictogram Categories** are encoded, which can then be referenced within the [Pictograms table](/docs/configurations/tables/general-settings/pictograms).

The table allows for the insertion of new records or the search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Pictogram Categories**

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results in the results grid.

**Insert Pictogram Categories**

To insert new codes, you need to click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button.

For the new record, at least the mandatory field required by the program must be entered: the **Code**.
