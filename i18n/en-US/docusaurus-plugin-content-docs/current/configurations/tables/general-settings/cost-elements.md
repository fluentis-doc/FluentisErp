**Percentage/Value**: indicates whether the cost item is of type: *percentage*, *fixed value*, or *variable value* (active only for cost items with **Appl.on...** = *Other Costs*). Specifically, the *percentage* is calculated based on the total cost indicated in the **Appl.on...** field; the *fixed value* is added to the total cost indicated in the **Appl.on...** field, while the *variable value* is multiplied by the quantity present in the management of *Other Costs* in costing.              
**Value**: indicates the default value of the cost item that will then be proposed automatically.
