## Simple ExtraData - Introductory Aspects (ExtraData Semplice - Aspetti introduttivi)

With simple ExtraData, it is possible to add new simple properties to an existing Fluentis object.  
The simple properties that can be added are of different types:
* Booleans.
* Strings.
* Integers, decimals.
* Arrays.

## Creating Simple ExtraData (Creazione dell'Extradata Semplice)

### Header (Testata)

Go to **Home > Utilities > ExtraData > ExtraData** and click on the **New** **ExtraData** button.

In this case, we proceed to create a **simple** ExtraData of type string called **Model (Modello)**.

The detail form for creating ExtraData is composed as follows:

* **Code (Codice)**: which identifies the extra data.
* **Content type (Tipo contenuto)**: will be of a simple type.
* **Widget Type (Tipo Widget)**: defines the display and selection modes for Object and Datasource types. For the Simple type, it should be left empty because the loaded widget will be the default widget of the framework associated with the data type.
* **Name (Nome)**: must be a word present in the dictionary; otherwise, we will need to add it.  
* **Data type (Tipo di dati)**: this is the type of data.
* **Stereotype (Stereotipo)**: additional options on the field formatting, such as multiline text or defining the number of decimals.
* **Description (Descrizione)**: is mandatory - description that will be displayed, just like the Name can be selected from the dictionary.
* **Validity Start/End**: if we want to assign temporary validity to the extra data.
* **View right / Modify right (Diritto di visualizzazione / Diritto di modifica)**: to associate a specific right that allows the viewing or modification of the extra data.

The stereotype can be activated for the *Data type (Tipo di dati)*: Date (DateTime and Time); Decimal (Currency and Numeric); Double, Float, and Long (Numeric); Int (Color, Numeric, and Year); Short (Numeric and Year); String (MultiLine).

The stereotype can be activated for all activated objects and for each individual object.

### Activations (Attivazioni)

The activation grid allows you to define the classes on which the ExtraData should be available.  
The grid is composed as follows:
* **Parent Object (Oggetto padre)**: is the object to which the ExtraData is linked, in our case FSItem. Each ExtraData can be associated with multiple objects.  
* **Property (Propriet√†)**: this is the property of the parent object where the ExtraData will be loaded. In this case, the ExtraData property is present on the FSItem object, generated by the reference that links FSItem to FSItemExtraData.  
* **Required (Obbligatorio)**: indicates whether the ExtraData is mandatory for the associated object.
* **To Print (Da Stampare)**: indicates whether the ExtraData should be available for printing.
* **Ordering (Ordinamento)**: this refers to the ordering of the parent object; it does not have repercussions on functionality and is usually left at 0.
* **Start valid (Start valid)** / **End validity (End validity)**: if the validity is temporary, it indicates the start and end of the period during which the ExtraData can be used.  
* **Stereotype (Stereotipo)**: the formatting of the field, which changes depending on the type of data. It would override the general stereotype defined for the extra data if one wanted to enforce a specific behavior for a particular object different from the default one.

### Inserting ExtraData into the Detail Form (Inserimento dell'ExtraData nella form di dettaglio)

One of the main innovations introduced from the major release Fluentis2021 is the ability to directly insert the widget that will load the content of the ExtraData into the detail form.  
In this case, since the ExtraData is of a simple type, the default widget of the framework associated with the data type will be loaded.

To include the ExtraData in the detail form of the item (FSItem), we can use the **form navigator** and **object navigator**.  
1. From the **Object Navigator**, expand the ExtraData node related to the business object and select the ExtraData of interest.
2. From the **Form Navigator**, expand the navigator up to the Generality tab where we want to insert the ExtraData.

To display the ExtraData in the detail form of the item, it is sufficient to drag and drop from the Object Navigator to the Form Navigator.  
In the example above, the ExtraData 'Model' has been added to the LayoutGroup that defines the header data of the item (FSItem).  
The ExtraData has been populated with a string type data.  

To make the display of ExtraData in the detail form of the item **persistent**, it is sufficient to create a specific profile and load it whenever it is necessary to display the ExtraData.

Finally, also in the detail form of the item, there is a specific tab called **Extra data (Extra data)** where we can find each ExtraData associated with the item.
