ERP software is a comprehensive platform that integrates all essential functions for managing a business (Accounting, Inventory and Order Management, Production, CRM, Supply Chain, Services, etc.) and is capable of automating and digitizing business processes and information across the entire organization.

The common feature of all ERP software is indeed a shared database that supports multiple functions used by different business units. This means that all employees within a company, whether from the Administration, Purchasing, or Marketing departments, can rely on the same information for their specific needs, so to speak, communicating in the same language.
