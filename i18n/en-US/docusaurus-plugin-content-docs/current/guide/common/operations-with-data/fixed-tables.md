The fixed tables include preset data, which the user cannot modify.

For example, the codes for [Amount Type](/docs/configurations/tables/finance/ledger-records-templates/insert-ledger-records-templates#amount-type) in accounting entries are essential for automatically valuing the journal based on the VAT and ledger data processed in the entry.
