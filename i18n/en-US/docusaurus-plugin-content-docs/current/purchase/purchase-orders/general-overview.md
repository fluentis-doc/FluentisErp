The module is located in the *Purchases > Purchase Orders* area and represents one of the intermediate steps in the purchasing cycle.

Purchase orders can be entered manually or automatically from purchase requests or purchase forecasts, or by taking data from purchase orders or purchase price lists.

The module allows the operator to also create the receipt of goods. By using the goods receipt, it is possible to fulfill the purchase order and place the goods in the warehouse/location before proceeding with the actual loading of the goods into the warehouse.

Before using the module, the following parameters and tables must be completed:
> - [Numberings](/docs/configurations/tables/fluentis-numerations)

> - [Purchase Order Parameters](/docs/configurations/parameters/purchase/purchase-orders-parameters)
