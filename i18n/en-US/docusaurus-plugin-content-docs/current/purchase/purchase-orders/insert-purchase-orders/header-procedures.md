The procedure for retrieving items from a purchase order allows for partial or complete fulfillment of the purchase order. All unfulfilled orders, non-forcibly fulfilled orders, and partially fulfilled orders are presented. For a purchase order to be fulfilled, it must be *Printed* and have a *Confirmation Date*.

In the document header, pressing the **Project Execution** button will open a form where it is possible to filter the orders related to the document supplier.

It is then possible to insert the items into the order, fulfilling an entire order or a single line, either partially or completely.

*Specific buttons*:

> **Search**: allows you to search for purchase orders;  
> **Execute**: allows you to transfer the selected items;  
> **Select/Deselect All**: allows you to select/deselect all items from the list;  
> **Activate/Deactivate Selected Rows Only**: particularly useful for fulfillment via grid; allows you to activate/deactivate the flags of all selected rows.

:::note
The procedure retrieves all the data present in the order, and as a result, the purchase conditions present in the order will be applied, even if these have since changed.
