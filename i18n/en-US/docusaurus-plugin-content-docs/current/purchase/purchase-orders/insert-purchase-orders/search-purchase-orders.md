The form opens via the path **Purchases > Orders > Supplier Orders**.

For an explanation of the features common to purchase documents, refer to the [Purchases section](/docs/purchase/purchases-intro).

#### Specific Buttons  

> **Execution property**: button to view the fulfillment status of items. In the upper grid, for each row, the ordered quantity and the quantity already delivered will be displayed. If the row has already been fulfilled, the linked fulfillment document (DDT and invoice) is shown in the lower grid. 
>  
> **Bulk Edit** (under the *Tools* button): button to massively edit some of the information contained in the selected supplier orders; a pop-up will appear where you can modify the following data: Our reference, Your reference, Notes, Requested delivery date, Order confirmation date, and other data.

**Update Prices** (under the *Tools* button): allows for the mass recalculation of item prices in the selected orders. Pressing this button opens a parameter window that allows you to decide:   
- whether to update prices using the price lists valid at the document date or at the item delivery date;  
- whether to modify prices only for non-fulfilled lines or also for partially fulfilled lines;  
- whether to also update the lines marked with *Manual Price*.  

The procedure recalculates prices considering all discounts, including those resulting from price management, and applies the selected tier for each line.
