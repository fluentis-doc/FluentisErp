The procedure gives the possibility to execute an invoice from a purchase order.

Conditions: the vendors of order and invoice have to be the same; the order has to have set the Printed flag and order confirmation date.

This procedure uses all data of order and consequently there will be the possibility to apply the order conditions, even if those are currently changed. On mask there are all printed, confirmed and not executed or partially executed orders for the selected vendor. At this moment the user has the possibility to: select the whole order (setting flag at the beginning of the order line); import the order on invoice thanks to button or select only a part of order items, possibly with different quantities. For this reason, after having performed a double click on order line, the user can select the whole quantity of the related line (setting flag at the beginning of the line), or it is possible to change the “quantity” field in order to execute order partially. In order to finish the procedure, the user has to click on “Transfer Items” button.
