The form opens via the path **Purchases > Invoices > Purchase Invoices (Acquisti > Fatture > Fatture di acquisto)**.

For an explanation of the functionalities common to purchase documents, please refer to the section [Purchases (Acquisti)](/docs/purchase/purchases-intro).

The specific buttons on this search mask are as follows:

> - **Reversal turnover**: with this procedure, it is possible to partially or fully reverse invoices. Once the button is clicked, a pop-up will open where you can select the item lines to be reversed along with the respective quantities, enter the *Document type* to be created (only types of Invoices with nature *Credit Note (Nota di credito)* can be selected), and enter the *Reversal Reason (Causale di storno)* for the warehouse (generally a shipping).    
The link between the reversal document and the original document must be manually entered in the Header of the new document.  
> - **ES document log**: this button becomes active if the selected invoice is in the SDI Checked status or later; it allows you to consult the history of the document's relationship with the SDI and view the generated XML file, without having to go through the [Incoming Purchase Documents (Documenti acquisto in entrata)](/docs/finance-area/sdi-documents/incoming-purchase-documents).
