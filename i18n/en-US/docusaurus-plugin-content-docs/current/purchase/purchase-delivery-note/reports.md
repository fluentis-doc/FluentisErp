Several **Reports** are available. To view a preview of each print, you need to set the desired filters and press the *Preview* button on the toolbar. This action will display the print on the screen without changing the document status. If you need to proceed with printing it on paper or saving it to a file, you should click the *Print Report* button instead.

### Purchase DDT Print (Stampa DDT di acquisto)

This print is used to print the purchase DDTs already entered into the system, according to the filters specified in the initial form.   
The first filters displayed are those related to the header information of the documents, such as *Document type*, *Document Number*, *Supplier*, and *project (progeto)*.    
In the *Advance search* group box, you can check the statuses of the DDTs to filter on.    
In the *ITEM* group box, you can filter not only by the item code but also by other information related to the document's body lines, such as *barcode*, *Item description*, or if there is a project linked to the item line.    

With this print, each DDT is paginated separately, each with the following sections:
- Header with Logo and company information
- Information on the DDT (type, number, date, etc.)
- Supplier information (VAT number, agent, etc.)
- DDT details (item code, quantity, price, etc.)
- DDT summary (total goods, expenses, total tax, etc.)


### DDT List (Lista DDT)

With this report, it is possible to print a list of the DDTs entered into the system. The presented filters are the same as those of the previous print, with the addition of the ability to select an *Ordering* of the invoices displayed, choosing between *Supplier*, *Invoice no.*, and *Invoice type*.    

In the print, under the same *supplier/supplier number/invoice type* (based on the chosen ordering), the DDTs are listed with the following data: currency, amount, item, quantity, price, VAT, etc.      
Each line of the list is occupied by an item from the DDT.
