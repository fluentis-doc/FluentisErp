The 'Search Sales Delivery Note' procedure has been created to enable the user to search delivery notes, previously inserted, in readiness in order to view, to edit, to cancel and to delete them, if necessary, after having obtained the necessary user's rights for realizing these operations.

Thanks to filters, it is possible to view: a document (e.g. search by document number), more documents (e.g. search by date), documents inserted in a year (e.g. search by year), documents inserted for a certain supplier (e.g. search by account/detail account). In addition, there is the possibility to search documents which have a certain item or a certain items class by using 'Search Items' procedure.

RIBBON BAR: it represents the Form menu, that is the area in which it is possible to perform actions. The list of features is the following:
