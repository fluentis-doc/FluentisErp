## RDA Print

The report is used to bulk print the requests already entered into the system, according to the filters specified in the initial form.    
The first filters shown are those related to the header information of the documents, such as *Type*, *Document Number*, *Supplier*, *entry date*, and *Demand date*.    
In the “Advanced search” groupbox, the states of the request that can be filtered can be checked. It is also possible to filter by *ITEM*, *Production job order*, or *Project* present in the purchase requests.    
To launch the print, once the desired filters are set, it will be enough to press the *Preview* button on the ribbon bar to have a print preview of the RDAs. If a physical print or a file output is required, it will be necessary to press the *Print Report* button.

The result of the print is a list of the RDAs present in the system; for each item contained in the purchase request, quantities, preferred supplier, price, and requested date are reported.
