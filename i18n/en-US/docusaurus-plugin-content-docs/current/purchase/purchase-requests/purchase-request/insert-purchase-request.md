## **1. Upper Section** {#upper-section}

The mandatory fields for entering a purchase request are as follows:

- **Type**: defaulted in *Configuration > Tables >* [*Purchase Request Types*](/docs/configurations/tables/purchase/purchase-request-type). Depending on the chosen type, certain functionalities such as *availability control (controllo della disponibilitÃ )* will be activated.   
- **Date/Year**: the current date is proposed by default, but it can be manually modified.   
- **Number**: automatically proposed based on the numeration associated with the *PD Type* chosen.

#### Other Data

- **Historicized**: by activating this flag, the PD will no longer be visible in the [Automatic Order Creation](/docs/purchase/purchase-orders/procedures/create-purchase-orders-from-purchase-requests) procedure.   
- **Notes**: allows you to insert notes visible at the PD level.   
- **Request status**: this is a non-editable field; it displays the fulfillment status of the entire request considering the fulfillment status of each individual item line. An PD is considered *Executed* or *Partially executed* when a supplier order has been generated for all or some of the item lines contained within it.       

## **2. Items** {#items}

In the item grid, the following data are available: 

- **Line type** provides the option to select from a combo box, items with different characteristics:
    - *Codified Item*: these are items coded in the registry and can be recorded in analytical accounting and registered in the warehouse.   
    - *Uncoded Item*: these are descriptive items that can be recorded in analytical accounting but cannot be moved in the warehouse.    
    - *Note Item*: these are descriptive notes reported in the document printout; they do not affect accounting and the warehouse.

- **Class/Code/Item Description**: can be entered manually or with the assistance of field help, which will suggest all related data entered in the *Item registry*. After entering the *Code*, the *Description* and *Class* will be automatically pulled from the registry. If the item has *Variants*, the desired variant can be selected from the *Item data* tab.

- **Units of Measure**: the primary unit of measure of the item is proposed, but if alternative units of measure are coded in the item registry, the user has the option to choose another.

- **Quantity**: represents the quantity of the primary U.M.    

- **Price**: the price is proposed from the default supplier price list for the item; the reference price list for the item itself is displayed in the *Discounts/Price Lists* tab. The same document may contain items with prices taken from different price lists. By double-clicking in the **Price list** field (in the *Discounts/List Prices* tab), the user has the option to select a different price list from the default one, from which the price of the entered item will be taken.   
In the absence of a price list, the proposed data can be taken from the *Latest cost* of the item registry or may be proposed as zero, based on the parameters set in the **Purchase Requests Parameters**.   

- **Forced Fulfillment**: forced fulfillment can be set for the selected line. This way, no warehouse loading will be done.

- **State**: indicates the fulfillment status of each item line.   

- **Demand date**: in the case of RA released from planning, this will automatically fill with the *End date* of the planned purchase order; it can also be entered or modified manually.   

- **Shipment date**: if the RA was released from planning and the *FOB date* of the planned order is valued, it will be reported in this field; it can also be inserted or modified manually. 

- **Estimated arrival date**: if the RA was released from planning and the *ETA date* of the planned order is valued, it will be reported in this field; it can also be inserted or modified manually. 

In the section below the grid, the document totals are reported:   

- **Origin amount**: reports the total taxable amount of the purchase request.    
- **VAT**: reports the tax value calculated on the taxable total, based on the VAT rate indicated for each item in the *Item data* tab.    
- **Total**: given by the sum of *Origin amount* and *VAT*.

#### Specific Buttons

> **Authorize PD**: allows you to authorize all selected item lines; from this moment the document is considered confirmed.   

> **RDO Generator**: clicking this button will create the [Offer Request](/docs/purchase/offer-request/settings) for the lines present in the *RDO Generator* tab. For further details, see the section [RDO Generator](/docs/purchase/purchase-requests/purchase-request/insert-purchase-request).
