The form is opened via the path **Purchases > Price Lists > Supplier Price Lists** and allows you to search, view, and create new supplier price lists.   

For an explanation of the functionalities common to purchase documents, refer to the [Purchases section](/docs/purchase/purchases-intro).   

In the filter section, you can filter by supplier, validity dates, currency, project, or item. 

*Specific button*:   

> **Closed**: this button allows you to mass modify the *Expiration Date* of the price lists present in the system. Clicking it will open a pop-up where you can enter the new *Expiration Date* that will be applied to all selected price lists in the grid.
