To view a print preview, it is necessary to set the desired filters and press the *Preview* button on the toolbar. This operation will display the print on screen without changing the status of the document. To proceed with printing on paper or saving to file, you need to click on the *Print Report* button.

### Purchase Order Confirmation 

This print allows you to print the orders as confirmations to be sent to the supplier.   
The first choice that is requested is between the *temporary* print and the *Definitive* print: the difference between the two types is that the temporary one has no effect on the status of the order, while the printed or digital document produced in definitive mode changes the document to *Printed* status.
The first filters shown are those related to the header information of the documents, such as the type of order, document number, date, supplier, and project.
In the Advanced Search groupbox, you can check the order statuses to filter by; for example, you can print fulfilled/unfulfilled orders, printed, canceled, etc.

With this print, each purchase order is formatted separately, each with the following sections:

- Header with Logo and company information
- Order information (type, number, date, etc.)
- Supplier information (tax ID, payment terms, bank, etc.)
- Order details (item codes, quantities, prices, etc.)
- Order summary (total goods, expenses, total tax, etc.)
