The module can be found in the **Purchases > Purchase Job Orders** area. By using purchase job orders, companies can establish contracts with their suppliers for the acquisition of certain volumes of products within an agreed timeframe. Such agreements not only allow for favorable economic conditions but also guarantee the availability of necessary goods, in exchange for the buyer's commitment to respect the contractually promised quantity by the established deadlines.   

## **Preliminary Configuration of the Module**

Before using the module, it is necessary to fill in the following tables and parameters:     
- [**Numerations**](/docs/configurations/tables/fluentis-numerations): entry of the numeration to be used for entering purchase job orders.     
- [**Purchase Job Order Type**](/docs/configurations/tables/purchase/purchase-job-order-types)
- [**Purchase Job Order Parameters**](/docs/configurations/parameters/purchase/purchase-job-orders-parameters)

## **Link to Other Modules**

Once contracts with suppliers have been agreed upon and the purchase order has been created, it can be fulfilled within the **Purchase Orders** using the *Get from project* button.     

By using the appropriate [parameters](/docs/configurations/parameters/purchase/purchase-job-orders-parameters/), it is possible to make fulfillment from the order mandatory when creating a new order and to lock the quantity of the order, preventing the fulfillment of amounts exceeding those predefined in the contract.
