The module is located in the **Purchasing > Purchase Orders** area.    

Through the use of purchase orders, companies can establish contracts with their suppliers for the acquisition of specific volumes of product within an agreed timeframe. These agreements not only allow for favorable economic conditions but also ensure the availability of necessary goods, in exchange for the purchaser's commitment to adhere to the contractually promised quantity within the established deadlines.   

### Main Features 

Once the contracts with suppliers are agreed upon and the purchase order is created, it can be fulfilled within supplier orders using the [Fulfillment from project]* button.   
By using the appropriate [parameters](/docs/configurations/parameters/purchase/purchase-job-orders-parameters/), it is possible to make fulfillment from the order mandatory when creating a new purchase order and to lock the order quantity, thus preventing the fulfillment of quantities exceeding those predefined in the contract.

- Orders are integrated with supplier registries and price lists, allowing for the automatic configuration of discounts, payment terms, and other specific conditions for each supplier.
- Orders can be monitored through various statuses (printed, confirmed, fulfilled, etc.), with real-time updates for all stages of the process.
- Approval phases, notification sending, and order updates can be automated through configurable workflows.

### Operational Benefits

- Improvement in financial management, thanks to predetermined prices that reduce uncertainty and facilitate economic planning.    
- Reduction of risks related to the lack of critical supplies, allowing for the maintenance of operational and productive continuity in the company. 
- Strengthening of commercial relationships with the involved suppliers.   
- Speeds up the process of entering purchase orders by allowing most of the information to be carried over from the fulfilled order.
