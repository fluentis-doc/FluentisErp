The module is located in the area **Purchasing > Requests for Quotation (Acquisti > Richieste di offerta)**. For explanations of functionalities common to sales documents, refer to the section [Purchasing (Acquisti)](/docs/purchase/purchases-intro).

In the filter area, it is possible to choose whether to display *open* and/or *closed* requests for quotations and whether to view *all versions* or only the latest version of each RDO.

Above the results grid, there are *tiles* that allow for quick filtering of the following types of Requests for Quotation: 
> **Confirmed with Success**: RDOs confirmed but not yet closed.    
> **In Progress with Success**: RDOs confirmed and converted into unfulfilled orders or linked to an RDA that has already been converted into an order.    
> **Closed with Success**: RDOs confirmed, closed, and converted into already fulfilled orders (or linked to an RDA that has already been converted into an order).    
> **Waiting for Confirmation**: RDOs not yet confirmed, not closed, and not linked to an RDA already converted into an order.    
> **Loosed**: RDOs not confirmed and not linked to an RDA that has already been converted into an order.  
> **Expired**: RDOs that have expired and are not linked to an RDA already converted into an order.  

#### Specific Button  
> **New version**: allows the creation of a new version of the selected quotation; this feature helps maintain the history of previous quotations.
