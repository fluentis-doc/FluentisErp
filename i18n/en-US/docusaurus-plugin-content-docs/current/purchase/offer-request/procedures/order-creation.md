title: Purchase Order Creation from Purchase Offer
sidebar_position: 4
---

This procedure allows the creation of a [Purchase Order (Ordine di acquisto)](/docs/purchase/purchase-orders/general-overview) starting from a *Offer Request*. 
   
The procedure consists of a filter section, where you can search more specifically for the RFQs, and a results grid where items are displayed individually. 

## 1. Apply Search Filters (Applicare i filtri di ricerca)

Among the specific filters in this form, we mention:     
- **View open offers**: if deactivated, it allows the visualization of already closed offers; otherwise, only those that are still open will be displayed; the lines of closed offers are shown in red in the grid.     
- **Not confirmed**: allows the visualization of offers without a *Confirmation date*.      
- **View already executed offers**: returns as a search result the offers that have already been converted into orders; the lines of executed offers are displayed in green in the grid.     
- **View not executed offers**: returns as a search result the offers that have not yet been converted into orders.    

## 2. Select Items (Selezionare gli articoli)
      
The grid displays the data of the items and the RFQs they belong to.    
To process one or more items, it is necessary to select them using the checkbox on the left of the lines. It is possible to choose to process a different quantity than the total quantity of the document: just indicate the *Confirmed quantity* to be fulfilled in the respective column.    
This procedure allows the creation of a Purchase Order starting from a Request for Quotation.

The procedure consists of a filter section, where you can search more specifically for the RFQs, and a results grid where items are displayed individually.

## 3. Create Supplier Order (Creare l'Ordine fornitore)

Click on *Create Purchase Order*.

In the pop-up that opens, choose whether to group the supplier orders by Requests for Quotation or by Account.
