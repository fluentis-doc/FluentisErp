  <summary>1. In the <b>Inventory View (Visualizzazione giacenze)</b>, how are the alternative unit of measure filters used?</summary>
  
This filter is used when the customer frequently changes the conversion factor of items for various reasons. The <b>sum of movements (somma dei movimenti)</b> filter considers the alternative unit of measure as the sum of the loading/unloading movements performed and takes the values present in the warehouse records. The <b>conversion factor (fattore di conversione)</b> filter, on the other hand, recalculates all movements by inserting the active conversion factor at the time of the search, therefore ignoring the internal value in the warehouse records and inserting the new conversion based on the new factor.
