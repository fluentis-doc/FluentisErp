*Specific Buttons*               
**Create Loading Unit List**: creates the UDC List from the selected loading plan;            
**Create picking**: creates the picking from the selected loading plan;

:::note Remember
To perform the *Create picking* from the Loading Plan, it is necessary to have first specified the dimensions of the plan.    
The dimensions are automatically calculated based on the dimensions, weights, and volume entered for each item in the [Weights/Dimensions](/docs/erp-home/registers/items/create-new-item) tab of its registry.
