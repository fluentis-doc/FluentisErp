In the **Load Plans Search (Ricerca piani di carico)** screen, it is possible to consult previously entered loading plans, as well as create UDC lists, picking, invoices, and DDT from the selected loading plan, using the buttons available in the header.

*Specific Buttons (Pulsanti specifici)*               
**Create Loading Unit List**: creates the UDC List from the selected loading plan;            
**Create picking**: creates the picking from the selected loading plan;             
**Create Invoice (Creazione fattura)**: creates the UDC invoice from the selected loading plan;              
**Creation of Delivery Notes**: creates the DDT from the selected loading plan.


:::note Remember (Ricorda)
To perform the *Create picking* from the Loading Plan, it is necessary to have first specified the dimensions of the plan.    
The dimensions are automatically calculated based on the dimensions, weights, and volume entered for each item in the [Weights/Dimensions (Pesi/Dimensioni)](/docs/erp-home/registers/items/create-new-items/item-registry/weights-dimensions) tab of its registry.
