The introduction to Fluentis picking management focuses on the creation and efficient management of picking lists to optimize logistical operations within companies. The system allows for generating picking from individual items through simple and quick procedures, such as the automatic entry of items through customer orders that facilitate the fulfillment process. Picking can be entered manually or automatically, for example from loading plans. From the Picking, it is possible to create a transport document or an invoice. Fluentis picking management represents a crucial element for optimizing logistical operations, ensuring efficiency and a high level of control over the processes of picking and handling of items.

It is possible to generate a picking manually, but also from a [Materials Picking List (Liste prelievo materilali)](/docs/production/pp-production-in-progress/picking-materials-list). Additionally, from a picking, it is possible to directly create [Delivery Notes (DDT)](/docs/sales/sales-delivery-notes/insert-delivery-notes/search-sales-dn) and [Sales Invoices (Fatture)](/docs/sales/sales-invoices/general-overview).
