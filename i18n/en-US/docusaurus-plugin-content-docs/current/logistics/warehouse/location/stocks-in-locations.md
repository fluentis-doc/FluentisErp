:::important Purpose
The "Stocks in Locations" feature of Fluentis is a crucial element for the efficient management of the warehouse, allowing users to monitor the placement of stored items within various locations.      
Thanks to an intuitive interface, operators can view in real-time the quantities available for each item and easily identify their specific location.
:::

The form allows the operator to view, for the selected item, all the locations where it is present along with the corresponding stock levels.

The form consists of two sections:
- the left side, where it is possible to search for the item of interest 
- the right side dedicated to displaying the locations, including stock levels, related to the selected item.

For anything not detailed in this document regarding the common operation of forms, please refer to the following link [Common Functions, Buttons, and Fields](/docs/guide/common).
