The current window enables the operator to complete the inventory lists after having inserted  [Insert Physical Inventory](/docs/logistics/physical-inventory/inventory-management/insert-physical-inventory)  into the window.

RIBBON BAR: it represents the Form menu, that is the area in which it is possible to perform actions. The list of features is the following: 



| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Search | Button to apply item search filters on the inventory list.  |
| Insert Item | It refers to the procedure to insert a new item into the list.  |
| Delete Items | It refers to the procedure to delete a new item within list. |
| Import | It refers to the procedure to import items inventoried by an external procedure.  |

For this reason, it is necessary to insert the inventored items. In order to do this it is necessary to be placed on the last record (or to click the [Insert Item] button from the ribbon bar) and to specify the following fields: 

**Item **(class, item code, description). It is possible to insert also through the Help;

**Possible Variant**;

**Option**;

**Warehouse**;

**Location**;

**Sales Job Order**;

**Customer/Vendor**;

**Possible Lot**;

**Quantity detected**;

**Possible alternative unit of measure and alternative quantity**;

**Notes**;

**Operator**.

Automatically it is possible to compile the following fields: Unit of Measure, Insertion Date and Stock at the date of insertion of the picking list.

Once having completed all the picking lists, that compose an inventory, it is possible to pass to the phase of  [Inventory differences](/docs/logistics/physical-inventory/stock-difference).
