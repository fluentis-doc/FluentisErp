The inventory module enables the operator to create inventory lists, to add them and to compare data of physical stocks with logic stocks data. Automatically and according to parameters inserted by the user, the system will proceed to adjust logic stocks with the physical ones, adjusting even the computer warehouse to the physical one. Once having performed this operation it will be possible to valorize stock (as regards this section please refer to the specific documentation).
