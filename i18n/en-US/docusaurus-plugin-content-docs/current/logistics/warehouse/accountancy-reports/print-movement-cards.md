The print can be found at the path **Logistics > Warehouse > Accounting Prints > Stock Movements Sheet (Logistica > Magazzino > Stampe contabili > Schede di movimentazione)** and allows the user to extract a report containing information related to warehouse movements. There are a series of filters and parameters to achieve the desired printout.

In this form, it is possible to filter by warehouse, reason, item, any variant, etc. By default, the print does not extract movements that are not of fiscal interest. However, it is possible to extract them by activating the related flag.

After entering the desired filters, it is possible to print standard or customized reports (after mapping in the print management). If you want to print a customized report, it is necessary to choose it from the list in the print parameters.

For everything that is not detailed in this document regarding the common functioning of the print forms, please refer to the following link [Preview and Print](/docs/guide/common/operations-with-data/reports).
