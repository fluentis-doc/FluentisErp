The printout is located at **Logistics > Warehouse > Management Prints > Rotation Index (Logistica > Magazzino  >  Stampe gestionali > Indice di rotazione)** and allows the user to query the database to extract a summary print of the items and their turnover index.

The turnover index of the warehouse, or warehouse turnover rate, is the ratio between the average quantity existing in the warehouse (the so-called average stock) over a certain period of time and the quantity sold during the same period.

WAREHOUSE TURNOVER INDEX = AVERAGE STOCK / WAREHOUSE DISCHARGE

This index expresses the number of times that the stocks of goods are completely renewed over the period in question.

The period considered can be the year, but it can also be a shorter period (a month, a quarter, a semester, etc.).

The calculation of the warehouse turnover index is important to understand the time required for the financial resources invested in the goods to be recovered.

:::note Note
To view the results regarding the turnover index, it is necessary to set the **Rotation Index** flag in the *Warehouse template* related to the movements of items, and simultaneously, the “Inventory (Rimanenze)” flag must be deactivated.
