The print option is located along the path **Logistics > Warehouse > Management Prints > Labels** and allows the user to query the database to extract a label printout for use in the warehouse. Most of the time, this printout includes not only the item data but also its barcode, which can then be used with WMSMobile.

In the grid, items for which you want to print the label can be entered. To insert an item into the grid, you can either type it using the keyboard or use the *Help items* which can be activated with a double click on the item number field. It should be noted that, by using the *Help items*, you can insert a maximum through multiselect.

Once the desired items are entered, it is possible to specify the number of labels to print for each item and print standard or custom reports (after mapping in the print management). If you wish to print a custom report, it is necessary to choose it from the list in the print parameters.
