The report can be found at the path **Logistics > Warehouse > Management Reports > Not Handled Items (Logistica > Magazzino  >  Stampe gestionali > Articoli non movimentati)** and allows the user to easily query the system and quickly extract information regarding non-moved items in the warehouse. This report thus allows for the creation of logistical statistics on the items.

After entering the desired filters, it is possible to print standard or customized reports (subject to mapping in the report management). If a customized report is to be printed, it must be selected from the document in the print parameters.
