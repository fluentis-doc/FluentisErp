The form consists of a first part for filtering, where it is possible to filter by movement date, warehouse, reason, and item. In the second part, the search results appear, which in this view display all the filtered movements with the details of the items, unlike the movements present in the warehouse registration grid. This way, it is easy to visualize all movements related to a specific item.
