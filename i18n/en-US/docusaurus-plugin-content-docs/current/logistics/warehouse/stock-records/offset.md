This tab is the same of the Record one, but it is active only if the warehouse template set on the Record tab has a warehouse and an offset template. The offset templates are set in case that user wants to manage a double stock movement with an onlyone record. So it is possible in the warehouse templates table to set a load template as offset of a unload template and vice-versa.

In Offset tab it is possible to view the data set within Record tab together with the possibility for the user to edit only some header data, as CC, Internal Document, Reference Document, Reference Document Date, Sales Job Order.

The movement line data have to be the same between 2 tabs; the same situation has to occur regarding Lots grids, Serial Numbers, Variants and Cost Centres of the single movement.

There is a situation in which it is possible to insert an item into the Record tab and other items into the Offset tab: this occurs only if the offset template linked to the main template activates the 'BOM' flag, that enables the user to load item in the Record tab (using so a load template) and to view the related BOM in the Offset tab, on which there will be an unload template. Obviously it can be managed vice-versa.

Typically it is possible to unload automatically the subcontractor delivery note, that performs the materials unload to be delivered to the subcontractor from raw material warehouse (or unfinished products), together with the load on subcontractor warehouse of the same materials, that should be used by the subcontractor in order to fullfil the subcontractor order.
