This feature allows you to search for all warehouse records present in the database with the purpose of viewing, modifying, and possibly deleting them, or proceeding to insert a new record; the window consists of a filter area and a results grid.

Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results within the results grid.

To open the details of a record, simply select it and double-click the mouse or click the **Modify** button (which allows you to enter the details and modify them) or the **View** button (which allows you to enter the details and view them but without the ability to modify).
