:::important What it is for (A cosa serve)
The introduction to the Fluentis warehouse history provides users with essential access to consult the historical data related to warehouse operations. This functionality allows for viewing a detailed archive of closures and valuations made over time, offering the ability to analyze information such as the last and average cost of each item, as well as the specific stock levels associated with each closure.

Thanks to the form dedicated to warehouse history, operators can consult data related to valued inventories and other logistical operations, ensuring that every piece of information is tracked and readily available quickly and easily. To ensure that the data is correctly saved within the history, it is essential to activate the Inventory Historicization flag during the valuation procedures.

The management of warehouse history not only supports the traceability of stock levels but also plays a crucial role in the review and analysis of company performance over time, facilitating the planning and strategic management of resources and associated costs.

This form allows users to consult historical data related to valued warehouse inventories (management area, tax category, last cost, average cost,...) generated through the [Valued Quantity Inventory procedure](/docs/logistics/physical-inventory/inventory-reports/valorized-inventory-with-quantity).

:::note **WARNING (ATTENZIONE)**
To ensure that the data is saved within the **Warehouse History (Storico di magazzino)**, it is necessary that when the **Valorized Inventory with Quantity** procedure is launched, the **Inventory historicization** flag is activated.
