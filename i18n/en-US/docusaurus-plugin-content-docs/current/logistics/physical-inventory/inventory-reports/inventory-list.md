:::important Purpose
Through this report, users can generate and view detailed lists of available article stock, allowing for an accurate verification of physical quantities. This approach greatly simplifies control and reconciliation activities, supporting the timely identification of stock variations.      
Inventory lists can be used not only for periodic inventory operations but also to monitor stock turnover and optimize procurement strategies.      
Additionally, integration with other warehouse reports ensures a comprehensive view of inventory management, fostering greater operational efficiency.
:::

The print function allows the user to view a report containing information related to filtered inventory lists. Along with warehouse data, item code/variant, batch, location, and unit of measure, the physical and logical stock values of individual items are also reported. Furthermore, there is an empty column called *Counted Quantity* that allows the user to enter the quantity detected during the inventory.

After entering the desired filters, it is possible to print standard or customized reports (subject to mapping in the print management). If one wishes to print a customized report, it is necessary to select it from the list in the printing parameters.
