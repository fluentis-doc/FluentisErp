:::important What It Is For (A cosa serve)
The introduction to Fluentis physical inventories allows operators to create inventory lists, conduct physical stock counts, and compare the obtained data with the logical stocks present in the system. Through an automated process, Fluentis facilitates alignment between physical stock and logical stock, thereby ensuring accurate optimization of resource management.

The form dedicated to physical inventories allows for the selection of existing inventories, composed of one or more inventory lists, to modify them or create new ones. Operators can easily input relevant information, such as the number, date, and notes related to the inventory, and can mark the inventory as "closed" once the necessary operations are completed. These functionalities ensure that inventories are managed effectively and that any discrepancies can be promptly addressed.

Furthermore, inventoried items can be entered manually or through assistance systems like WMS, thus facilitating the entry and recording of stocks. After completing the pick lists, it is possible to proceed with the calculation of inventory differences, making the warehouse management process even more precise and efficient.

The form opens through the path **Logistics > Physical Inventory (Logistica > Inventari fisici)** and allows for the selection of inventories present in the database. Inventories are the entity that groups one or more inventory lists.

It allows searching for inventories that match the specified filter data for the purpose of viewing, modifying, and possibly deleting them, or proceeding to insert a new list; the window consists of a filter area and a results grid.

Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to view the results within the results grid.

To open the details of a list, simply select it and double-click with the mouse or click the **Modify** button (allows entering the details and modifying them) or the **View** button (allows entering the details and viewing them but without the ability to modify).

From this form, a new list can also be entered using the **New** button.
