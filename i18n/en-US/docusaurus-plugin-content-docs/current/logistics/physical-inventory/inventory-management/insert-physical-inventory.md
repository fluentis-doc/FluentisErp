sidebar_position: 4

The form opens via the path **Logistics > Physical Inventories (Logistica > Inventari fisici)** by clicking the **New** button.

*Procedure*

Enter the number, date, description, any notes, and the operator. 
The flag **Closed** allows the inventory to be marked as closed once the inventory differences have been executed, and it will therefore no longer be considered for the stock alignment procedure.

Once the inventory is entered, it is necessary to complete the grid of inventory lists that make up the inventory by specifying the **List type**, **User**, and the relevant **Warehouse**. It is also possible to enter a *Closing date* to ensure that the list is not considered for the calculations of inventory differences.

Once the inventory lists are entered, they need to be filled. To do this, select the desired inventory list in the grid and double-click on it to access the [Modify Item Inventories (Modifica inventari articoli)](/docs/logistics/physical-inventory/inventory-management/inventory-lists-management) window.
