This window allows the operator to complete the inventory lists after entering them in the [Physical Inventory Entry](/docs/logistics/physical-inventory/inventory-management/insert-physical-inventory) window.

It is therefore necessary to enter the inventoried items. With the entry of the items, the fields for *Units of Measure*, *Insert date*, and *Stock* are automatically completed with the date of the pickup list entry.

Once all the pickup lists that make up an inventory are completed, it is possible to proceed to the [Inventory Differences (Differenze inventariali)](/docs/logistics/physical-inventory/stock-difference) procedure.
