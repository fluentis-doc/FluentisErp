:::important What itâ€™s for
The **planning** of shipments is a fundamental tool for optimizing logistics management within a company. It allows for the planning, monitoring, and coordination of all activities related to the shipment of goods, ensuring efficient distribution of resources and optimization of time. Therefore, by visualizing crucial data such as schedules, carriers, vehicles, and customers, the **planning** facilitates the scheduling of daily activities, reducing delays and improving delivery punctuality. Additionally, by integrating functionalities such as managing inactivity periods and updating the status of shipments, it provides a comprehensive and updated overview of logistics operations, promoting better decision-making and greater operational efficiency.

The shipment calendar can be found at: Logistics > Shipments > Calendar

The **shipment calendar** displays all shipments entered into the system, grouped in a timeline view based on driver/carrier/vehicle/customer/no grouping.              
Upon opening, the displayed range will be today's date + 7 days if there are shipments in that period, otherwise, it will show the first subsequent interval where shipments are present. 

In addition to shipments, the calendar also shows periods of inactivity for vehicles and carriers. 

In the left column, there are data related to **driver/carrier/vehicle/customer based on the chosen grouping**, and the various shipments are positioned in the calendar grid.            
Even if the duration of the shipment is only one hour, in the calendar it will be shown as a full day for easier visibility. If a more precise view is desired, click on **Hourly timeline view** from the ribbon bar.                    
This way, the shipment will be displayed with the size actually corresponding to its duration. This option can be useful if zooming in/out (ctrl + mouse scroll) to go into maximum hourly detail of the day.               
To return to viewing shipments in daily mode, click the **Daily timeline view** button on the ribbon bar.
