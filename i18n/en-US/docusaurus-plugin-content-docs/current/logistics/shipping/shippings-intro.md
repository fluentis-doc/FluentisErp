This new tool has been developed to optimize and simplify the shipping process, allowing for more effective and integrated control of all logistics activities. The **shipping management (gestione spedizioni)** by Fluentis includes the **groupage** function, which allows consolidating different shipments of goods from various senders but directed to the same geographic area into a single load or container.       
This enables more efficient use of the available space on transport vehicles, such as trucks, maritime containers, or planes, and offers a more cost-effective service compared to shipping individual goods.         
Additionally, an **advanced planning tool (avanzato strumento di pianificazione)** has been implemented that allows viewing shipments by vehicle, driver, carrier, and customer. Thanks to a simple drag & drop functionality, operators can easily organize shipments, move them forward or backward, and change the assigned vehicle or driver, ensuring more flexible and responsive management.

These are closely related to the [*Items register*](/docs/erp-home/registers/items/create-new-items/create-new-item) and [*Sales Orders*](/docs/sales/sales-orders/settings) since it is possible to add items directly from an order.
