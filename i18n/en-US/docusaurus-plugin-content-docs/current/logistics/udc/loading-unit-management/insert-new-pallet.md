In order to create a new Pallet it is necessary only to insert a new line on the main grid, specifying year, group, number and type. These fields establish the unique key per pallet. The register fields related to dimensions and weights would be automatically completed and could be changed, if necessary. It is obligatory to insert the operator (who has to get rights for pallet creation) in order to set the pallet load warehouse. The documents fields are used only if the pallet is created by picking and picking list procedures.

Once having created pallet it is possible to insert item or items that form it. In order to do this it is necessary to select pallet from the main grid and therefore to insert a new line on the second grid (the one of items). The insertion has obligatory to specify class, code (variant in case that the item is managed per variant) and quantity. Even in this case the documents fields are used only if the creation is performed starting from automatic procedures.
