In the Fluentis Sales module, the management of customer orders allows for controlling and optimizing the entire order cycle. 
Customer orders in Fluentis can be generated through various methods:

- From Offer: A customer order can be automatically created from a previously accepted offer, maintaining consistency between the proposed commercial conditions and the confirmed ones.
- From Supplier Order: It is possible to generate a customer order from a supplier order, useful for companies that operate with drop-shipping or on-demand processes, ensuring a direct alignment between procurement and sales processes.

## Preliminary Configuration of the Module 

> - [Numerations](/docs/configurations/tables/fluentis-numerations): definition of numbering for orders.    
> - [Sales Order Parameters](/docs/configurations/parameters/sales/sales-orders-parameters): specific settings for managing orders.     
> - [Grouping Parameters](/docs/configurations/parameters/sales/orders-grouping): configuration for managing groupings for fulfillment procedures.     
> - [Sales Order Types](/docs/configurations/tables/sales/sales-order-types): creation and classification of types of orders.
