The module is located in the **Sales > Customer Orders** area.

In the Fluentis Sales module, the management of customer orders allows for controlling and optimizing the entire order cycle. Customer orders in Fluentis can be generated through various methods:

- From Offer: A customer order can be automatically created from a previously accepted offer, maintaining consistency between the proposed commercial conditions and the confirmed ones.
- From Supplier Order: It is possible to generate a customer order from a supplier order, useful for companies that operate with drop-shipping or on-demand processes, ensuring a direct alignment between procurement and sales processes.

**Main functionalities**:
- Complete management of registries: Customer orders are integrated with customer registries, price lists, and predefined commercial conditions, allowing for the automatic configuration of discounts, payment terms, and other specific conditions for each customer.
- Traceability of the order status: Orders can be monitored through various statuses (entered, confirmed, etc.), with real-time updates available for all stages of the process.
- Automated workflows: The phases of approval, notification sending, and order updates can be automated through configurable workflows, improving operational speed and reducing the risk of errors.
- Reporting and order analysis: It is possible to access detailed reports that analyze order volumes, fulfillment times, uncompleted orders, and other KPIs useful for improving sales management and business performance.
