Several standard **Reports** are available. To view a preview of each print, you need to set the desired filters and click the *Preview* button on the toolbar. This operation will display the print on the screen without changing the document's status. If you need to proceed with the paper printing or save it to a file, you must click the *Print Report* button instead.

## DDT Print 

This print is used to bulk print the sales DDTs that have already been entered into the system according to the filters specified in the initial form. The first choice requested is between *Temporary* and *Definitive* printing: the difference between the two types is that the temporary print has no effect on the status of the DDT, while the paper or digital print executed in final state changes the document to *Printed*. The first filters shown are those related to the header information of the documents, such as document type, document number, and customer. In the *Advance search* group box, you can select the DDT statuses to filter and the project indicated in the document header. In the *ITEM* group box, you can filter not only by item code but also by other information related to the body of the document lines, such as barcode, item description, or if there is a project linked to the item line.        
With this print, each DDT is formatted separately, each with the following sections:
- Header with Logo and company information
- Information about the DDT (type, number, date, etc.)
- Customer information (VAT number, agent, etc.)
- DDT details (item code, quantity, price, etc.)
- DDT summary (total goods, expenses, total tax, etc.)

## DDT List

With this print, it is possible to print a list of the DDTs entered into the system. The filters presented are the same as in the previous print, with an additional option to select an ordering of the shown invoices by customer, invoice number, and invoice type. 
In the printing, under the same customer/number/type of invoice (based on the chosen sorting), the DDTs are listed with the following data: currency, amount, item, VAT, etc.         
Each line of the list is occupied by an item of the DDT.
