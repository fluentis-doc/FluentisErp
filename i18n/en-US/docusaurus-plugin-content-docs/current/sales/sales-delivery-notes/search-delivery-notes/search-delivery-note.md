title: Search Delivery Note
---

The Search Sales Delivery Note procedure has been created to enable the user to search easily delivery notes, previously inserted, in order to view, to edit, to cancel and to delete them, if necessary, after having obtained necessary user's rights for these operations.

Thanks to filters it is possible to view: a document (e.g. search by document number), more documents (e.g. search by date), documents inserted in a year (e.g. search by year), documents inserted for a specific customer (e.g. search by account/detail account), documents inserted for a specific agent or related to a sales job order (only if the job order has been inserted on header). In addition there is the possibility to search documents, which have a specific item or a specific class of items by using 'Search Items' procedure.
