The module is located in the **Sales > Delivery Notes** area.

In the Fluentis Sales and Logistics module, the management of Delivery Notes (DN) allows for tracking and documenting the movement of outgoing goods, optimizing the logistics process and ensuring regulatory compliance. 

**Creation and Main Features**:
- Manual or automatic creation: It is possible to create DN manually or generate them automatically from one or more customer orders, with the ability to split the delivery of goods into multiple DDTs, thus managing partial shipments.
- Entry of commercial information: The system allows associating specific information for the customer with the DDTs, such as agents, commissions, discounts, payment methods, and deadlines, ensuring that all commercial conditions are met.
- Management of multiple types of DDTs: DDTs can be classified based on their commercial nature, allowing for quick and accurate filtering of documents.
- Uncoded items and variants: It is possible to enter uncoded items in the DN, specifying only the description, or manage variants of items with additional attributes, displaying the combinations directly in the DN.
- Expenses and notes: The DN can include additional expenses for the shipped goods, along with the possibility of entering specific notes for each item.
- Batch and warehouse management: The reservation for the unloading of batches directly from the DN is provided, with automatic updates of stock levels and goods movement.
- Printing and customizations: It is possible to print the DN with customized layouts for the client, along with labels for the shipped goods.
- Integration with images and barcodes: The system allows viewing images of the items within the DN and managing reports via barcode, speeding up the preparation process for shipments.
