Conditions: customers of order and delivery note have to be the same; the order has to set the 'Printed' flag and 'Order Confirmation Date'; document types have to be compatible: on 'Order Types' table the order type has to contain the related delivery note type.

This procedure uses data of order and consequently the sales conditions of order will be applied, even if these ones do not currently correspond (e.g. update price lists). On mask there is the possibility to propose for the selected customer all printed, confirmed and not executed or partially executed orders. In this moment the user has the possibility to: select the whole order (by setting the flag at the beginning of the order line); import the order into the delivery note thanks to the button or to select only a part of order items, possibly, with different quantities. For this reason, after having performed the double click on order line, the user can select the whole quantity of the related line (setting flag at the beginning of the line), or can change the 'quantity' field in order to execute order partially. In conclusion, the user has to click on 'Transfer Items' button.
