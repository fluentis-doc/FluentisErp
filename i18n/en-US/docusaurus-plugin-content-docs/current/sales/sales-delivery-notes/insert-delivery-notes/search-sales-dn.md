#### Specific Buttons 
> **Transfer**: with this procedure, it is possible to partially or fully cancel the DDTs. Once the button is clicked, a pop-up will open where you can select the item lines to be canceled with the respective quantities, enter the Document Type to be created (only DN types with nature *Return* can be selected), and enter the Warehouse cancellation reason (generally a loading).      
The link between the cancellation document and the original document must be manually entered in the *Header* of the new document.
