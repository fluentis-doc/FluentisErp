The **Create POS** form opens via the path **Sales > POS > Create POS** or through the **New** button found in the *POS* search form.

## **1. Required Data (Dati obbligatori)**

In the data entry form, the **Date** and **Year** are automatically proposed as the current values but can be modified.

To continue creating the sales invoice, the user must enter the required fields:

- **Pos type** as specified in *Configuration > Tables > Sales > POS Types*.

- **Number**: each document is assigned a number according to the numbering specified by the user in the [POS Numbering](/docs/configurations/tables/fluentis-numerations) table and based on the document type that contains the numbering.

- **Account**: using the [field help](/docs/guide/common/operations-with-data/manual-entry-or-help-and-data-selection) or typing [directly](/docs/guide/common/operations-with-data/manual-entry-or-help-and-data-selection) the data.

:::danger[Attention (Attenzione)]
This field is not relevant for managing [**POS accounting**](/docs/sales/pos/pos-accounting).

The amount type on the reason line for the customer sub-account will be set as *Total Document / registration*.
:::
