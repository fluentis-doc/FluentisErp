The module is located in the path **Sales > POS (Vendite > POS)**.

The POS allows you to manage sales directly at the checkout, with advanced tools for the creation and management of invoices, issuance of receipts, and automatic updating of inventory levels.

**Main Features (FunzionalitÃ  Principali)**:
- Manual creation of invoices: The POS allows for the immediate generation of invoices, with automatic input of the customer's commercial information, such as agents, commissions, discounts, payments, and due dates.
- Automatic entry of items: The system automatically retrieves information about items, including prices and discounts, directly from the registry or sales price lists, speeding up the invoicing process.
- Management of non-coded items: It is possible to enter items not present in the registry by specifying only the description, useful for managing sales of occasional products or services.
- Management of expenses and notes: The POS allows for the entry of discounts and expenses related to the sold goods, along with the possibility of adding specific notes for each item, ensuring maximum flexibility.
- Partial fulfillment of orders: Invoices can be generated from orders with the possibility of partially fulfilling items, maintaining traceability of what remains to be shipped or delivered.
- Automatic generation of effects: The system allows for the automatic generation of effects related to the issued invoices, reducing manual work and improving financial management.
- Printing and customization of invoices: Invoices can be printed directly from the POS, with customized layouts for customers.
- Automatic accounting: Issued invoices are automatically accounted for, updating the accounting and financial records without the need for manual intervention.
- Management via barcode: The POS system supports sales management and the creation of reports through barcode reading, speeding up checkout operations.
