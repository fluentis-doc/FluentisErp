Once the button is clicked, a pop-up will appear where you can select the item lines to cancel along with the respective quantities, enter the Document Type to create (only Invoice types with nature *Credit Note* can be selected), and enter the Warehouse Cancellation Reason (generally a charge). It is possible to cancel lines of type 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.   
> - **ES status**: this combo box shows the SDI Status of the selected invoice, including: Not Examined, Controlled, To Be Sent, Canceled, Excluded, Generated. It is possible to modify the SDI Status directly from this mask. For more information, please refer to [Electronic Invoicing Management](/docs/finance-area/e-invoice/create-electronic-invoice).          
> - **Electronic invoicing**: this section contains the [Electronic Invoicing](/docs/sales/sales-invoices/invoicing/sales-invoice) status of the selected document, and the button **ES document log** which is enabled if the selected invoice is in SDI status *Controlled* or later; it allows you to consult the history of the document's relations with the SDI and view the generated xml file, without having to go through the [Outgoing Sales Documents](/docs/finance-area/sdi-documents/outgoing-sales-documents).
