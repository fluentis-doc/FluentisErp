The payment solutions are shown automatically by customer register and can be edited/deleted by the user. If a financial discount is associated to the payment type, the discount amount is considered only for accounting purposes on document maturities and not on total invoice. If document is created by a sales order, the payment types can be taken by the first document, by customer register or in a form it is possible to view all payments of documents to be executed and the user selects the payment typology involved. If document is created by a delivery note, it is possible to mantain payments in customer register or to mantain the single payments in every delivery note; in this case payment type is reported on invoice together with the same amount origin and VAT as the delivery note one. In addition a new line is added for possible item lines that have been added on invoice and that do not come from a delivery note.
