Within the ‘Giveaways' tab it is possible to set some general elements about invoices accounting. 

**Giveaways Accounting**: through this flag it is possible to activate giveaways accounting management, by activating the following fields. If the invoice, that user is accounting, has a giveaway but the management parameters have not been set, system will ask to user to confirm the missing setting through a warn. In this situation it will be possible to record invoices without management of giveaway line, that will be managed manually on accounting. In case that giveaways management is activated, but without inserting any detail accounts in the following fields, system will add the necessary reversal revenue to accounting movements by using the same detail account set for sales item. On the contrary, if the 'Substitute Item Account' flag has been set, it will be possible to activate the field, in order to set the detail account for accounts reversal, which will be used in place of the item detail account in these additional lines. The 'Account for VAT Reversal' flag operates in case that the gift item is under the responsability of user or not (with or without flag). This amount will be recorded and writen off in case that it is inserted into account for VAT reversal, without it the operation will have to be managed manually on accounting (even on this field there is a user confirmation message/warning for the missing setting).
