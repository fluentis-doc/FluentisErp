title: Discount Category Correspondence for Purchases/Sales 
sidebar_position: 5
---

In this mask, it is possible to consult and enter new correspondences for discount categories. The generic discount category (for example, that of the parent company) is associated with a discount category for sales and a discount category for purchases. 
Retailers can receive the catalog imported using the procedure [Supplier Prices](/docs/purchase/purchase-price-lists/procedures/supplier-price) from the parent company with a price applied with a discount category; the retailers will, in turn, sell the product applying a different discount category. Different suppliers may have the same discount category but different sales and purchase discount categories, as they have the same parent company but apply different discount conditions.     
The first part of the mask allows filtering results; the result columns are as follows:           
**Item class**: contains the item class corresponding to a specific discount category;         
**Account/Subaccount/Description**: contains the registry to which the discount category is associated;        
**Discount cat. sales**: contains the discount category with which the registry sells the item;      
**Purchase discount category**: contains the discount category with which the registry buys the item;        
**Update formulas**: contains any formulas to be used in the price update procedures;      
**From validity date**: contains the date from which to consider the item class, the discount category; in this way, it is possible to associate different categories in different periods of the year;         
**Discount category**: contains the discount category applied by the parent company; this is the field that links the purchases module with the sales module.
