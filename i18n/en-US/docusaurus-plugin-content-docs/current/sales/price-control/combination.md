title: Combination Type Discount Search
sidebar_position: 2
---

In this mask, the method for searching a discount is coded.      
In the first grid, the **Code** and **Description** of the search combination are defined.      
In the second grid, it is necessary to flag the columns corresponding to the fields in which to search for the discount among: **Account**, **Commercial category**, **Item class**, **Price management discount category item sales**, **Detail category** (indicates a manual code that is not coded) and/or **ITEM**. 
This table is used in the sales module to indicate where to search for the discount among the documents with the flag. In case of multiple flags set, the priority is decided based on the order inserted in the table [Discount Attribution Priority (Priorit√† attribuzione sconti)](/docs/sales/price-control/priority). The discount will be used in the procedure for [Defining Discount Policies (Definizione politiche sconti)](/docs/sales/price-control/definition).
