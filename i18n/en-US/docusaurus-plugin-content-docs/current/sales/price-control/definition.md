**Class/Item/Description**: contains the item recipient of the discount policy;        
**Commercial category**: contains the commercial category to consider;      
**Category discounts price management**: contains the discount category associated in the Formula table;       
**Date**: contains the validity of the discount policy; this allows for the application of different policies at different times of the year.
