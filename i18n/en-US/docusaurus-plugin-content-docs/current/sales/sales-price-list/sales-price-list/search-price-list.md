The form opens via the path **Sales > Sales Price Lists**.     

For an explanation of the features common to sales documents, please refer to the section [Sales](/docs/sales/sales-intro).

The specific button for this search mask is **Close price lists**: this button opens a pop-up where you can enter an end validity date for the price list; after this entered date, the price list will no longer be valid. If there are any documents for the selected sales price lists with dates later than the end validity date entered in the pop-up, the date change will not occur for these documents, and the documents will be reported with the following data:         
- Sales document type
- Code and description of document type 
- Document number 
- Account
- Document date 
- End price list date
