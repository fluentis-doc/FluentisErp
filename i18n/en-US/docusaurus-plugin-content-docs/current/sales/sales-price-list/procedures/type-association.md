In this procedure, the associations of sales price lists linked to commercial categories are displayed.    
In the first grid, there are references for the association and the linked commercial category. This link indicates that the group of types of price lists that are part of the [Association](/docs/sales/sales-price-list/procedures/category-association) is valid for the chosen commercial category.      
In the second grid, however, it is possible to enter **Discounts** valid for the association selected in the first grid.         

By double-clicking on a row in the first grid, you can open the **Association** for editing.      
In the form that opens, you can enter at the top the **Association type**, consisting of a code and a description, and a **Starting validity date** to propose in the price lists. There are also buttons to propose priority and discount in the price list rows.       
In the grid, the types of price lists to be considered in this association are entered. It is possible to manually enter the types or propose the general price lists using the button in the ribbon bar **Propose the general price lists**.      
The **Default** flag indicates that this type is default among all.     
The **Itself** flag allows for considering a customized price list in the customer registry when the association occurs.     

At this point, the group of price list types present in the association is valid for the inserted commercial category.
If it is necessary to massively associate these price list types in the customer registry, use the procedure [Customer Price List Association by Commercial Category](/docs/sales/sales-price-list/procedures/category-association).
