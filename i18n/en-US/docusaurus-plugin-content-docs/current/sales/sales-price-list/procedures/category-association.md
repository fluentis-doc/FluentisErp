In this procedure, it is possible to bulk link customers to the [Sales Price List Type Associations](/docs/sales/sales-price-list/procedures/type-association).  
On the left grid, the previously created associations are displayed. It is important to note that the association involves a group of price list types valid for the entered commercial category. Upon selecting a row, all customers belonging to the entered commercial category are presented on the right; if no commercial category is entered, all registries are proposed. It is possible to filter the registries to conduct a more targeted **Search**.      
Select the registries where you want to enter the price list types.  
The procedure is executed by clicking the **Apply to all** button or **Apply to selected customers** button on the ribbon bar. In this way, in the customer registry, on the price lists tab, the price list types present in the association will be proposed, which will be valid for the customer's documents.
