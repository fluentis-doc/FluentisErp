The module is located in the **Sales > Quotes (Vendite > Offerte)** area.

In the Fluentis Sales and CRM module, the management of quotes allows for the creation, monitoring, and updating of commercial proposals, directly integrating them with business processes. Quotes can be associated with both [CRM contacts](/docs/crm/home-crm/contacts/search-contacts) and [registered customers](/docs/erp-home/registers/contacts/create-new-contact/general), allowing for granular control over the entire sales cycle.

**Key Features (FunzionalitÃ  principali)**
- Centralized creation and management of quotes: Quotes can be generated using predefined templates that can be customized with the Duplicate feature and the use of Versions, with the ability to include details such as discounts, payment terms, and specific conditions.
- Integration with customer and CRM contact records: The quote is directly linked to existing records, enabling consistent data management between the CRM and Sales modules.
- Automation and workflow: Quotes can be subjected to workflow rules that trigger notifications, approvals, or further actions, improving the efficiency of the decision-making process.
- Reporting and analysis: Detailed reports can be generated on quotes, analyzing conversion rates, approval times, and other KPIs to support the management of business performance.
