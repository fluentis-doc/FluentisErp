In the Fluentis Sales and CRM module, the management of quotes allows for the creation, monitoring, and updating of commercial proposals, directly integrating them with business processes. Quotes can be associated with both [CRM contacts](/docs/crm/home-crm/contacts/search-contacts) and [registered customers](/docs/erp-home/registers/contacts/create-new-contact/general), allowing for granular control over the entire sales cycle.

## Preliminary Module Configuration 

> - [Numerations](/docs/configurations/tables/fluentis-numerations): definition of numbering for offers.
> - [Sales Offers Parameters](/docs/configurations/parameters/sales/offer-parameters): specific settings for managing offers.   
> - [Sales Offers Types](/docs/configurations/tables/sales/sales-offer-type): creation and classification of types of offers.

Alternatively, the [**Fast Start**](/docs/guide/fast-start) procedure is available.
