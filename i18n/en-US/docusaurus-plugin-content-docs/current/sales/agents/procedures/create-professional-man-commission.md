The form opens via the path *Sales > Agents > Procedures > Create Professional Man Commission*.

This procedure allows for executing/restoring the creation of the recipient compensation within the general accounting.

## Commission Liquidations 

In this tab, the user has the option to search for settlements that have not yet been valued in a recipient's compensation.

The available filters to facilitate the search are:
- Detail account agent 
- Year / Number / Date of the settlement (from - to) 
- Description assigned during the creation of the agent settlement 

:::note[Recalculate Enasarco Flag]
With the flag active, a recalculation of the values related to Enasarco contributions will always be performed; therefore, if within the commission settlement (when entering edit mode after creation) the radio button *Manual Calculation* has been set (in order to manually force the data calculated by the system), if you do not want the Enasarco data to be **still** recalculated and reset in the compensation, you must deactivate the flag before creating the compensation.

The flag **DOES NOT** affect the recalculation of data related to the withholding tax (if present in the commission settlement).

After selecting the various rows, by pressing the *Calculate settlements* button, the compensation for the recipient is created.
