The module is located in the *Sales > Agents* area.

The module offers a complete solution for the management, control, and processing of sales agents' commissions. This functionality allows companies to calculate accrued commissions, generate detailed settlements, and manage compensations for professionals.

**Main Features (FunzionalitÃ  Principali)**:
- Management and control of commissions: The system allows managing, controlling, and processing the calculation of commissions due to agents, taking into account sales made and specific contractual conditions.
- Generation of settlements: It is possible to generate periodic settlements for agents, aggregating the accrued commissions and presenting a clear overview of the amounts due.
- Creation of compensations for professionals: Fluentis offers the opportunity to create specific compensations for external professionals, ensuring flexible and detailed management of payments.
- Printing of pay slips and documentation: The module allows the printing of pay slips for agents, detailing the accrued commissions and completed settlements, thus providing clear and transparent documentation.
- Reporting and analysis: It is possible to generate reports on commissions and settlements, facilitating the monitoring of agents' performance and enabling detailed analysis of sales.

**Automation and Integration (Automazione e Integrazione)**:        
The Agents Settlement module is integrated with the rest of Fluentis' management system, allowing for the automatic retrieval of sales data and commissions from the sales and invoicing modules. This integration reduces the risk of errors and ensures data consistency, facilitating reconciliation between sales, invoices, and settlements.

It is, in turn, connected to the Administration module, allowing the conversion of commission settlements into compensation for the recipient in order to automatically execute the related accounting entries and the payment of withholding tax as well as ENASARCO contributions. Finally, the compensation of agents will also be included in the tax processing of the unique certification of withholdings.
