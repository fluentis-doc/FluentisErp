The Summary section shows all commission calculation elements. Within the “Summary of Commissions” grid there are, currency by currency, the total settled commissions. Below this grid, there are those fields that have the reference currency of settlement (proposed by the inserted currency in agent register), exchange and currency date for exchange; more below there is VAT to be applied to the commission amount origin (proposed automatically by agent register) and lastly the document. On the right, the first grid enables the user to view professional men compensations to be considered as accounts on settlement in use, withholding-tax type to be applied (even this proposed by agent register or agent category) and the related percentages and amounts for the withholding-tax. If manual calculation is set, it will be possible to force data related to the management section of withholding-tax.
