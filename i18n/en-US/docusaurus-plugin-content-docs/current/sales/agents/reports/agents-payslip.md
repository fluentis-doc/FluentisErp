The form opens via the path *Sales > Agents > Agent Settlements > Prints*.

The print allows you to extract from sales documents the commissions entered for various agents, regardless of the agent's commission accrual criterion.

In the section **Print the commission of**, you select the type of document to consider: the customer order (ordered), the delivery note (delivered), or the invoice (sold). Depending on this option, the filter for **Document type** will change.

It is worth noting the printing option with item detail: this version of the report can be useful for checking the accuracy of the commissions entered by the system and for identifying errors in the agent registry settings.
