The 'print accrued commissions' procedure performs a simulation of agent accrued commission calculation, according to register setting and filters applied on report. In particular, it is important to remember that, in case of collected commissions, this report will view the accrued data by excluding values of automatic settlements created in the ERP, that will become obligatory in order to obtain an alligned report; on the contrary, in case of commissions on invoiced/delivered/ordered, the right use of a filter by dates enables the user to obtain a correct result independently from the automatic procedure of commissions settlement.

As regards print filters/parameters, it is important to remember the 'Print Commissions Accrued at' field that indicates the reference date for collection commission calculation and the 'Print Debit vs/Agent on Date' flag with which it is possible to activate the following date: through this option it is possible to simulate the report of commissions accrued on that date, considering among them the accrued commissions on the following date (that usually are excluded). The 'Consider commissions zero for total of commiss. amount origin' flag enables the user to consider the commiss. amount origin even those which have a zero commission value.
