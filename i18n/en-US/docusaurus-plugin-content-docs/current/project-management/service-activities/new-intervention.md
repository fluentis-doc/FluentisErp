The data to be entered are:

**Intervention type**: contains the [type of Intervention](/docs/configurations/tables/project-management/intervention-type/);

**Client**: contains the client recipient of the intervention;

**Year/Number/Date**: contains the data of the intervention; in the case of a date modification, it will be asked whether to also update all other dates of the document (expenses, services);

**Asset**: indicates the resource responsible for the intervention, proposed by default on new lines.

**Employee**: indicates the employee linked to the resource registry.

There are specific tabs available.

## Header 

This tab contains general information about the intervention, such as **Currency**, **Exchange**, any **Notes**, and the **Audit Trail**. There is a potential **Price list** linked, the flag indicating if the intervention is **Invoiced**, and the **Intervention status**.

The expected states for the intervention are as follows: 
- <u>Inserted</u>: initial state of the intervention, indicating a document just entered. 
- <u>To be approved</u>: state used to give visibility from the resource that all required data has been entered, recalculates expenses for the conditions entered in the intervention, adding any travel allowances, etc. The Billing Plan is generated to provide a preview of what will be invoiced. 
- <u>Approved</u>: state used by the person responsible for verifying the interventions declared by the resources, for which the related activity declaration is generated for the resource. 
- <u>Verified</u>: state in which the intervention is considered invoicable.
- <u>Invoiced</u>: invoiced intervention. This state cannot be assigned manually. 
- <u>Partially Invoiced</u>: state that identifies an intervention with some invoiced lines in the invoice plan and others not. 
- <u>Forced closed</u>: state that identifies a forcibly closed intervention that has not been nor will ever be invoiced. It is also possible to assign a custom suspension reason.
- <u>Suspended</u>: state that identifies a temporarily suspended intervention, excluded from billing, but which can be restored later. 

**Payments Tab**, **Discounts Tab** allow the configuration of data useful for the invoices that will be issued.

**Extra data**: any extra data entered for the intervention.

**Documents attached**: any documents attached to the intervention.


## Expenses 
This is divided into three further subgroups:

**Actual Travel Expenses**: indicates the expenses incurred by the resource, which are normally proposed from the resource registry if present. They will be inserted in the activity declaration - travel expenses tab generated by the intervention and can also be marked as to be invoiced. Each line can have its own attachment, e.g., a receipt. 

**To invoice Travel Expenses**: indicates the expenses to be invoiced to the client, which are normally proposed from the client registry if present. They can also come from expenses incurred marked to be invoiced. They will be included in the Billing Plan.
Only expenses specifically configured as travel type expenses will be selectable. 

**Extra Charges**: other generic expenses to include in the Billing Plan. 

It contains any travel expenses, identified by:

- **Asset**: resource that incurred the expense, by default proposed is the resource from the header;
- **Charge type**: contains the type of charge, with the related **Description**;   
- **Charge Date**: date on which to allocate the expense;     
- **Charge amount**: it is possible to directly indicate the amount of the expense, for example, in the case of reimbursement for a meal;     
- **Km**: contains the kilometers traveled with the related **Km cost**;    
- **Hourly cost**: hourly cost in the case of "Travel Hours" type expenses;    
- **Date/Hour departure**: contains the date and time of departure;    
- **Date/Hour to arrive**: contains the date and time of arrival;    
- **Travel hours**: indicates the travel hours calculated based on date and time;    
- **Forfait Value**: as an alternative to the expense amount, it is possible to have a flat rate value. Generally filled in the resource registry and proposed automatically; it will not be modifiable by the user. Used in cases where the reimbursements due to the resource are pre-agreed and non-modifiable by the user;
- **VAT**: indicates the VAT to apply;      
- **Full Costing**: calculated field based on previously entered data that contains the total cost of the expense (e.g., km for cost per km, travel hours for hourly cost, etc);     
- **To Refund**: this flag indicates if the charge is to be reimbursed; 
- **Attachments**: indicates if the line contains associated attachments;
- **Note**: any notes entered by the user;

In the case of an Intervention Type with the External flag enabled, the expected expenses for the resource will not be proposed in the Sustained Expenses tab. Instead, the expenses entered in the Expenses-Intervention tab in the client registry will be proposed in the Expenses to Invoice tab based on the configurations. 

Button **Expenses to Invoice**: present in the "Intervention expenses incurred" tab, selecting an expense and clicking the button, this will automatically be moved to the "Expenses Intervention to Invoice" tab. If the expense type is already present in the expenses to be invoiced or the client has configured a flat rate, the user will be asked for confirmation to proceed with the recalculation. 

Button **Recompute expenses**: to be used only when necessary, the same procedure is already executed when changing the state of the intervention from "inserted" to "to be approved". 
The procedure performs: 

1. Calculation of **expenses to be invoiced** to the client: if in the client registry expenses with the "live expense" flag enabled have been configured and the same expense has been declared by the resource in the incurred expenses, this will automatically be considered as to be invoiced;
> In the case of expenses of a type different from distance/travel hours, the expense amount declared by the resource will be taken and moved to the expenses to be invoiced;

> In the case of expenses of distance/travel hours type, it is possible to indicate in the client registry the cost per km/hour, and with the recalculation, a merge of the km/hours declared by the resource and the costs configured in the client registry will be performed, obtaining a complete expense of all data and the total;
2. Calculation of **flat rate expenses**: if in the client registry flat rate expenses with conditions for resource/per day have been configured, these will be automatically recalculated. 
:::note[Example]
In the intervention lasting one day, there are 3 resources, thus 3 service lines are declared. 
The flat rate expense is configured as follows: 

Highway: 100 - one-time
Lunch: 50 - per person per day

The flat rate expense to be invoiced will total 250 (100 fixed highway, 50 lunch for each resource). The calculation will be performed when changing the state of the intervention from "Inserted" to "To be approved" or using the Recalculate Expenses button. 
:::

3. Calculation of **Expenses Intervention to Invoice**: if modified by the user, it will ask for confirmation before proceeding, and if affirmed, it will restore the expected expenses to be invoiced for the client.
4. Calculation of the **travel allowance** for the resource;

:::note[Example] 
 In the resource registry, a limit of "2" travel hours is set.
The calculation of the travel allowance will only trigger if the sum of services + travel hours exceeds 2 hours beyond the ordinary hours:

 8 ordinary hours

 3 travel hours

 --> 1 line will be added in the expenses with the predetermined amount for the travel allowance
 
 6 ordinary hours

 3 travel hours

 --> there will be no travel allowance, as the minimum beyond the 8 hours is 2 of travel (in this case, we would have 9 hours, so only 1 hour beyond the 8 ordinary).

::: 

## Services Tab 

Contains the list of services expected in the intervention. Each line can relate to either a coded service or not, and the related details: 

- Effective service date: indicates the date on which the service was performed. It may be different from the date in the header, as there can be multiple services performed on different days in an intervention. This date will be used for generating the activity declaration of the resource;
- **Start hour**, **Start pause**, **Break end time**, **End hour**: times at which the service was performed;
- **Smartworking**: flag that is automatically enabled based on the smart working configurations in the resource registry. It will then be used in payroll processing to identify the days when smart working was performed. It will consequently be set in the activity declaration generated by the intervention;
- **Overlapped service**: flag that is automatically enabled if it detects the presence of other services or activity declarations for the resource on the same day or time slot;
- **Overlap minutes**: it is possible for the user to manually indicate the actual time for which activities overlap;
- **Effective time**: total hours obtained from the calculation of the hours declared in the service;
- **Service description**: description of the item entered in the case of a line of type Coded;
- **Description of activity performed**: description entered by the resource regarding the service performed, and in the case of project selection, description of the Project line. It will then be used for the description of the automatically generated Activity Declaration from the intervention. By double-clicking on the field, it is possible to enlarge the area to write. 
- **Units of Measure**: UM of the item or manually modified by the resource, of only temporal type
- **Quantity**: if the Project parameters and the conversion between different UMs are correctly configured, the effective time will be converted into the corresponding UM. 

:::note Example 
Service with effective time of 8 hours, service unit of measure "GG-days".

In the general project parameters, the unit of measure for days is "GG-days" and the unit of measure for hours is "HH-hours". The Daily Hours configured in the parameters are 7 for that day.

The quantity will be automatically recorded as 1.14 GG. (Obtained from the conversion of 1 GG = 7 hours).
:::

**Unit price**, **Total price**, **Total amount**, **VAT**, **Discounts**: data related to price and VAT obtained from the respective customer and item price list settings;
**Asset**: resource that performed the service, by default proposed is the one present in the header, but can be modified;
**Progress percentage estimation of the work**: percentage of work completed, updates the corresponding value in the project;
**Sales Turnover**: sales revenue assigned based on priority from the item registry or client registry;
**Project**: inherited from the intervention header if present, or manually associated by the operator. It updates the eventual price if the service is not valued, determines the activity category;
**Ticket**: reference ticket for the service;
**Main Asset**: EAM plant registry linked to the service; 
**Employee**: employee associated with the resource;
**Advance invoice**: Advance invoice present in a project (even different from that assigned to the service) and linked to the service, which will result in the erosion of the residual amount of the total advance invoice, along with the correct reversal in billing;
**Note**: any notes from the client. 
**Invoiceable**: if enabled, identifies the service that will be considered in the billing plan. The value of the flag is defined by the upstream documents from which it was generated, or by the project, or by the activity category;
**Manual price**: flag that identifies whether the price proposed by the price list or procedures has been manually modified by the user;
**Value added activity**: flag that identifies value-added services for statistical purposes. Valued based on the project; if not present, based on the configuration of the activity category. Can be manually modified by the user. 

There are two additional tabs: **Linked documents** and **Extra data**, freely fillable.

## Materials Tab 

This tab contains the materials used in the intervention, which may appear as linked to previously entered Services or can be filled in freely. The Materials present the related data such as Item Code, and the related Description, Quantity, Price, etc. 
Selecting a material row, it is possible to fill in the sub tabs **Materials Total** (which contains data such as the Reference Warehouse, the Price List or any Discounts) and **Extra data**. 

The specific buttons of the ribbon bar are:

![](/img/neutral/common/delete.png) Delete materials: deletes the selected materials;

![](/img/neutral/common/new.png) New material: inserts a new material row;

![](/img/neutral/common/view-material.png) View materials without services: displays only materials without linked services in the grid;

![](/img/neutral/common/view-material.png) View materials linked with services: displays only materials linked with services;

![](/img/neutral/common/view-material.png) View all materials: displays all materials.

![](/img/neutral/common/delete-discount.png) Delete material discounts: deletes discounts linked to the selected material.	


## Summary Tab 

This tab contains the Summaries of the intervention, which can be consulted.
It is also possible to enter any final expenses indicating the Type, the Amount, the presence in the invoice or not with the related flag, and the VAT. These data will modify the summaries on the right.

Finally, it is possible to enter final Notes.

## Billing Plan Tab 
The Billing Plan (or Invoice Plan) contains a preview of the invoice that will be generated from the intervention. This tab is automatically calculated when the intervention status progresses from Inserted to To Be Approved. However, it can be recalculated at any time using the "Generate Billing Plan" button.

The rows present are inserted starting from the data present in: services, materials, expenses to be invoiced, and other expenses. 
The rows of services and materials may have Row Type "1 or 2 - coded or uncoded", while expenses will have row type "3-expenses"
The rows will have a 1-1 correspondence between services/materials/expenses and invoice plan. 
Only in the case of services will the rows be able to be divided:

e.g., a service lasts more than 8 hours. In the invoice plan, if the calculation of out-of-hours is expected, the service line will be divided into 2: 

1. service line for 8 hours, with all references and prices entered in the services tab
2. out-of-hours line for the hours exceeding 8, with a rate assigned from the price list, and a different item code depending on the configurations (project parameters or time slots where a change of item is expected)

Each line also has its own status: 
1. To Invoice: the line will be considered by the intervention valuation procedure;
2. Suspended: the line will NOT be considered by the intervention valuation procedure until its status is restored to To Invoice;
3. Excluded: the line will NOT be considered by the intervention valuation procedure in any case;
4. Invoiced: the line has already been valued and is therefore already included in a sales invoice. 

The other data present in the line are: 
- item code / variant / variant description / item description that are data related to the item code used
- Description for planned activities / sprint, actual service date and effective time: data obtained from the services tab, reporting the description entered by the user regarding the performed service and the actual date and time of the service.
- rounding value: if specified by the billing rules, the total hours calculated in the services may be rounded. The value to be added to achieve the desired total is indicated in this field. 
- unit of measure: reference unit of measure for the line;
- Quantity: quantity based on the unit of measure;
- Price: price established in services/materials/expenses or recalculated for out-of-hours
- Tax: VAT rate applied;
- It is out of hours: flag that indicates if the line in question has been calculated automatically and is due to exceeding the indicated hours in the time slots.


Each line also has additional details: 
each of these is inherited from the original tabs (services/materials/expenses) but can then be modified. 
- sales revenue: sales revenue indicated in the project, and if absent, item revenue;
- invoice item: item that will be inserted in the invoice. This field is used when, for example, the option for managing travel hours as service hours is enabled. In this case, the row in the invoice plan will have the item for travel expenses, while in the Invoice item field we will find the service item to which the travel hours have been merged. 
- activity category: activity category derived from the project or manually; 
- ticket: ticket number associated with the row;
- plant registry: plant registry associated with the row; 
- employee: employee registry associated with the row, derived from the assigned resource. 
- Project: reference project line; 
- Advance Invoice: advance invoice present in the project and linked to the line of the billing plan. Indicates that the line will contribute to the erosion of the amount and quantity of the advance invoice. 
- suspension reason: in the case of line status "Suspended", it is possible to indicate the reason for suspension; 
- Annotation: free annotation; 
- Discounts and Tier Type: discounts and related tier to be applied on the value of the line, presenting the same methods used in other documents
- Price list: reference price list for the line
- Manual Price: flag that automatically activates if the price in the line has been manually modified compared to the automatically calculated price.

The billing plan is generated with specific rules that can be configured at the customer level or project parameters level. 
The priority with which the information is retrieved is as follows: 

- checks the configurations present in the customer registry: if present, it also checks the correspondence for intervention type and workplace (data present in the resource holding the intervention). 
In the case of configurations with null intervention type or null workplace type, they are considered valid for all types of intervention/workplace. 

- if no correspondence is found in the customer, the search extends to the [project parameters](/docs/configurations/parameters/projects/project-parameters/) > interventions > Work Report Valorization Settings

The rules set at the general parameters level are valid for all customers or for certain commercial categories of customers. 
If the commercial category field is empty, it is valid for all categories. 
Then the configurations for intervention type (exact match or null intervention type) and for Workplace (exact match or null Workplace) are sought.


Based on these correspondences, the most appropriate configurations will be used. If no correspondence is found, the billing plan will remain empty. 

## Examples of billing plan calculation
Let us assume that the current configuration for the following examples is:

>Time slot: Mon-Fri 08:00-20:00 max daily 8 hours
>Rounding: up to 8 hours rounds by 2, after 8 hours it rounds to the half hour. 
>That is: service 3.15 h --> will become 4 invoiceable hours; service of 7.30h --> will become 8 invoiceable hours; 8.15 of service --> will become 8.30 invoiceable.
>Travel hours included in services: enabled

The times set do not indicate that the activity will take place from 08:00 to 20:00, but that within this time frame, a maximum of 8 hours can be performed after which the out-of-hours calculation will trigger. Additionally, exceeding this time slot will also trigger the out-of-hours calculation, even if it is less than 8 hours. 


:::note[Example 1] 

:::

:::note[Example 2]
>Travel hours: date 05/09 - 2 h
>Service: date 06/09 - 08:30-12:30/14:00-18:00 - 8 h

>Billing plan: service 06/09 8 h. 
In this case, the travel hours are not considered because with the option to consider travel hours as a service being active, on 05/09, there being no service to merge the travel hours with, these are not considered in the billing plan.
