This procedure allows you to analyze the work progress statuses. In the filter area, you can specify a series of filters to search for projects more precisely. Once the filters are entered, you just need to click **Search** in the ribbon bar to display the results in the grid below. To carry out the procedure, select a row in the grid and click the **WPS Project Analisys** button by project in the ribbon bar. This will open a screen where you can consult the work progress information of the selected project.

In the **Work project status** tab, the completed progress statuses for the project are reported. Each row will contain one [Work Project Status](/docs/project-management/work-project-status/new-work-project-status/), along with the corresponding Number, Date, etc. If there are many progress statuses present, it is possible to group them using the **Groups** button in the ribbon bar, which will prompt you to enter a Title, and then group the selected progress statuses into a single **group**.

In the **Summaries** tab, using the Explode and Collapse buttons in the ribbon bar, you can view the various levels of the skeleton along with the related data.
