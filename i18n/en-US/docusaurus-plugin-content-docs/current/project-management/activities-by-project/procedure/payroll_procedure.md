Project Management > Activity Procedures > Payroll Values Calculation

From this screen, it is possible to automatically calculate the data for payroll slips.

The hours and expenses (only those with the reimbursement flag) entered in the payroll slips will be taken from the activity declarations, regardless of whether they were entered directly in Project Management Area > activity declaration or generated automatically from interventions with Approved status. Therefore, it is essential that each activity declaration is associated with an activity category configured with the corresponding payroll code.

By default, the period to be calculated defaults to the current year and the month prior to the current month.

Before proceeding with processing, it is necessary to carry out the following configurations:

> - [Payroll Codes](/docs/configurations/tables/employee/Payroll_codes)     
> - [Task Categories](/docs/configurations/tables/project-management/task-category)    
> - [Expense Types](/docs/configurations/tables/general-settings/expenses-types)
