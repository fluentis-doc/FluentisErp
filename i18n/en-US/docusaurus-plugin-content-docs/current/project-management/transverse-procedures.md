After configuring the calendar, you can proceed with the calendar synchronization for the use of **Project management** and thus **Calendar Resource Planning (Pianificazione a calendario delle risorse)**:

:::note Note (Nota)
In the **Employee** form, the *User* field must be filled by associating it with the user entered in **ARM**:

From the **Project management** module, in the *Calendars management*, we see that the resource calendar has been appropriately entered:

The next step is to create the resource in **Project management**: by entering the Operator field, the link with the created calendar located in **Calendars management** is established. In this screen, it is possible to define who the operators are that have rights on the calendar for modifying interventions, creating, or deleting:

The resource that has rights on the employee calendars can directly access the calendar view through the **Planner**, displaying the interventions:

Once the planned interventions in **Service Activities** are released, the resource will find the intervention in the Fluentis calendar and Outlook.
