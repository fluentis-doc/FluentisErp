The **Project Search (Ricerca Progetti)** allows you to search for projects that have already been entered and to add new projects.

import SearchForm from './../../import/sections/search-form.md'

<SearchForm />

A specific button on this form is **New Project from Template**: it allows you to create a new project starting from a pre-existing template. It is necessary to indicate the **Project type**, the new **Client** to which it is destined, and the **Creation date**.
