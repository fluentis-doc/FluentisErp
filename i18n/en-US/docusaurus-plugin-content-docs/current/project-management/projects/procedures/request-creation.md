**Project**: it is possible to indicate the project branch from which to filter resources.

Once the filters are entered, just click **Search** in the ribbon bar to display the results in the grid below. 
The resulting rows show the allocations of the resource, along with the relevant characteristics of the activities and the project. 
At the bottom of the screen, there is the flag **Set as Confirmed** if the document should be created already confirmed, thus effectively to be planned.
In addition to the flag, it is possible to specify the **Intervention Request Type** and the **Planned intervention type**.
The priority with which the Type of Intervention Request or the Type of Planned Intervention is considered is as follows: 
- 1 - if the Type of Intervention Request or the Type of Planned Intervention is present in the procedure screen, it will be used to create the new documents
- 2 - if no configurations are present on the screen, the Type of Intervention Request or the Type of Planned Intervention configured in the project line will be considered
- 3 - if no configurations are present in the project, the Type of Intervention Request or the Type of Planned Intervention configured in the general project parameters will be considered.

After selecting a row, it is possible to use the specific buttons in the ribbon bar to execute the procedure and create an **Intervention Request** or a **Planned Intervention**.
