This form allows you to launch a report that displays the bills of materials containing a specific item.

It consists of two sections:

**Filters**: to filter by the component for which you want to execute the implosion. The version is predefined based on the default data entered in the respective management table; the validity date is automatically proposed as equal to today's date. You can also optionally enter the variant and decide if you want the component implosion operation to occur on the finished product.

**Results Grid**: in this section, the results derived from the filter options entered in the previous section will be displayed; in addition to the component, information related to the reference set will also be shown.

To launch the report, simply click on **Preview** (in this case, a preview of the report will be shown, and you can decide whether to print, how many pages and copies to print, or whether to export the file) or click on **Print Report** (in this case, the report will be printed directly).
