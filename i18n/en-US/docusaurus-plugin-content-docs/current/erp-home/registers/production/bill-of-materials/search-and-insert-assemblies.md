**Introduction**: [Bill of Materials](/docs/erp-home/registers/production/bill-of-materials/bom-intro) 

Allows the insertion of new records or the search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results in the results grid.

To insert new records, it is necessary to press the **New** button present in the ribbon bar. 

In the results grid, by clicking on the assembly you want to view/modify, you will be directed to the [Structure Management](assemblies/structure-management) form, where it will be possible to view and/or modify the structure of the bill of materials and all the information related to the parent item of the bill and its components.

**Calculate minimum level**: this is a procedure that calculates the minimum level of each item present in the bills of materials. It is used by the MRP. Manually launching it can only be useful in certain cases for testing and understanding if there are any issues with this type of calculation.
