This form allows you to launch a report that enables the comparison of two different bills of materials.

It consists of 4 sections:

**Assembly (1)**: to manually enter or use **Item Help** for the parent of the first bill of materials to compare. The version is pre-determined based on the default data entered in the respective management table; the validity date is automatically proposed to be the same as today's date. The other information to be entered is related to the item, specifically class, code, description, and variant;

**Assembly (2)**: to manually enter or use **Item Help** for the parent of the second bill of materials to compare. Version and Option are predetermined based on the default data entered in the respective management tables; the validity date is automatically proposed to be the same as today's date. Finally, you can enter information related to the variant such as class, code, description, and variant;

**Component List with the following characteristics**: to decide to check only some components of the bills of materials to compare; for example, by filtering by item class, the printout will check the differences between the 2 assemblies only regarding the components belonging to that class. The same filtering works for Item Type, Characteristic, Variant, Merchandise Category, and Preferred Supplier. Finally, in this section, you can decide the maximum explosion level for which to display the information for the bills to compare, and whether to view the explosion for purchasing assemblies;

**Valorization to**: to decide what cost should be presented in the printout next to the row of the displayed item. The available options are Last Cost, Average Cost, Standard Cost, Selling Price, and Standard Cost next year. These are a series of fields available in the Costs tab of the Item Registry.

To launch the report, simply click on **Preview** (in this case, a preview of the report will be displayed, and you can decide whether to print, how many pages and copies to print, or whether to export the file) or click on **Print Report** (in this case, the report will be printed directly).
