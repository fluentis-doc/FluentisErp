This form launches a report that allows you to view the list of components of the bill of materials, filtered based on a series of parameters.

It consists of 5 sections:

**Filters**: to manually enter or use the **Item Help** for the bill of materials whose structure you want to view.

*Version* and *Option* are predetermined based on the default data entered in the respective management tables; the *Validity date* is not proposed automatically but can be entered manually. The other information to be entered is related to the item: *class, code, description,* and *variant*. Additionally, you can decide the *Highest level of explosion* for which to display the information for the bills of materials to be visualized; you can also choose to explode the *Assemblies of purchase items* that make up the bill using the appropriate flag.

**Components**: to limit the display of components to a single component or a group of components, filtering by item class, variant, item type, characteristic, and goods category, or by entering only part of the code and/or description of the component;

**Report type**: to decide how detailed you want the list of components of the bill of materials to be visualized. The printout can be 'Analytical' or 'Summarized', and depending on the option you choose, you will obtain more or fewer details on the print report;

**Options**: to decide whether to display in the print report also the Total Quantity, and/or the variants;

**Result Grid**: in this section, the results resulting from the filter options entered in the previous section will be displayed.

To launch the report, simply click on **Preview** (in this case, a preview of the report will be shown, and you can decide whether to print, how many pages and copies to print, or whether to export the file) or click on **Print Report** (in this case, the report will be printed directly).
