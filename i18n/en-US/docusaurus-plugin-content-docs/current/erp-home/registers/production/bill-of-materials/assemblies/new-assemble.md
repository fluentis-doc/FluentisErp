**Introduction (Introduzione)**: [Bill of Materials (Distinta base)](/docs/erp-home/registers/production/bill-of-materials/bom-intro) 

The procedure for creating a **New** opens through the path:

**Production > Bills of Materials > Bills of Materials (Produzione > Distinte Base > Distinte Base)**, by clicking on the button present in the ribbon bar;

or

**Production > Bills of Materials > New bill of materials (Produzione > Distinte Base > Nuova distinta base)**

In both cases, the [Bill of Materials (Distinta Base)](structure-management) form will open, consisting of a section where the mandatory characteristics of the assembly will be defined, and a section composed of various tabs that group its specific characteristics.
