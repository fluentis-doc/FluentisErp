This form allows you to run a report that enables viewing bills of materials, filtered based on a series of parameters, valued according to the choices set in the appropriate sections.

It consists of 6 sections:

**Filters**: to manually enter or use **Help article** to specify the bill of materials whose structure you want to view. **Version** and **Option** are predetermined based on the default data entered in the respective tables; the validity date is not automatically proposed but can be manually entered. The other information to be entered is indeed related to the item, including class, code, description, and variant, but you can also choose to filter by component. Additionally, you can decide the maximum level of explosion for which to display information for the bills to be viewed, and you can choose to explode purchase assemblies and perform the valuation by deciding to use costs taken from the preferred supplier's price list, which can be set in the appropriate selection box;

**Options**: to decide whether to also display the variants of the items and whether to show the total quantity to be used for each component;

**Valorization to**: to decide which cost should be presented in the printout next to the row of the displayed item. The usable options are Last Cost, Average Cost, Standard Cost, Selling Price, and Standard Cost next year. These are a series of fields present in the Costs tab of the Item Registry;

**Valorization type**: to decide whether the valuation of the levels of the bill should be carried out based on the item's cost (in this case, the displayed item would simply show the last, average, or standard cost, etc., present in its registry) or based on the cost of materials (and in this case, the displayed item would show the sum of the costs of the lower-level materials);

**Report type**: to decide up to what level of detail you want to visualize the list of components of the bills of materials. The print can be 'Analytical' or 'Summarized', and depending on the chosen option, you will obtain more or fewer details in the print report;

**Result Grid (Griglia di risultato)**: in this section, the results derived from the filter options entered in the previous section will be displayed;  
To run the report, simply click on **Preview** (in this case, you will see a preview of the report and can decide whether to print, how many pages and copies to print, or whether to export the file) or click on **Print Report** (in this case, the report will be sent directly to the printer).
