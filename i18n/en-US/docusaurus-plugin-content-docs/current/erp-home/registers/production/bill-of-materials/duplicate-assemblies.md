It is possible to use filters to search for the bill of materials from which to start for duplicating the new bill that you want to create.

Once the filters are set and the **Search** button is clicked, the results of the search are displayed in the **Items to Duplicate** result grid.

The user can select an item present in the results grid, which will become the starting item for duplication, and enter in the section at the bottom of the page the class, code, version, and possibly the variant of the item on which to copy the selected bill (company and division are automatically set to be equal to the company and division in which the work is being done).

It is also possible to choose to set the **Alternatives** and **Phases** flags, which, when activated, allow for the duplication of the alternatives and production phases of the starting item.

Once all the data is set, by clicking on the icon located on the ribbon bar called **Duplicate Assembly**, the procedure will be activated that generates, for the specified item, a bill that is exactly identical to the starting one.

*Specific button*: 

> **Duplicate Assemblies**: a button that activates the procedure that allows for the duplication of an assembly.
