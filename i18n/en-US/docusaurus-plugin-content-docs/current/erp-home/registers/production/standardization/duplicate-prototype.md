It is possible to use filters to search for the prototypes from which to start for the duplication of the new prototype that you want to create.

Once the filters are set and the **Search** button is clicked, the results of the search are displayed in the grid.

The user can select an item present in the results grid, which will become the starting item for duplication, and go on to enter in the section at the bottom of the page the class, code, version, and possibly the variant of the item from which the selected bill of materials is to be copied (company and division are automatically set to the company and division in which you are working).

You can also choose to set the flags **Materials**, **Extra data**, **Cycle phases**, **Cost elements**, and **Documents attached**, which, if activated, allow for the duplication of the related data present in the starting prototypes.

Once all the data is set, clicking on the icon on the ribbon bar called **Duplicate** will activate the procedure that generates, for the specified item, a prototype that is exactly identical to the starting one.

*Specific button (Pulsante specifico)*:

> **Duplicate**: button that activates the procedure that allows duplicating an assembly.
