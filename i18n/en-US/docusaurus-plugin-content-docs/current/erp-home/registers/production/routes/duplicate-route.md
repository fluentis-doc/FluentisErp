The **duplication of work cycles (duplicazione cicli di lavorazione)** allows for the use of filters to search for the cycle(s) from which to start the duplication of the new cycle you want to create.

Once the filters are set and the **Search** button is clicked, the results of the search are displayed in the central grid.

The user can select an item present in the results grid, which will become the starting item for the duplication, and proceed to enter in the section at the bottom of the page the class, code, version, and possibly the variant of the item on which they want to copy the selected cycle (company and division are automatically set to be the same as the company and division in which they are working).

Once all the data is set, clicking on the icon located on the ribbon bar called **Duplicate production cycles** will activate the procedure that generates, for the indicated item, a cycle that is exactly identical to the starting one.
