In this form, it is possible to define a link for the valuation of costs/revenues on cost and profit centers (*Configuration > Tables > Controlling*) for the documents/registrations addressed to the entity in use.

This association takes into account and interacts, however, with other options for the valuation of cost and profit centers (according to the item, the general chart of accounts, the warehouse) that can be defined module by module.

The priority of reading in the valuation of cost/profit centers is set, year by year, within the [Accounting Parameters](/docs/configurations/parameters/finance/accounting-parameters#center-proposal).

**N (N)**: represents the row number.

**Cc/Pc (CdC/CdP)**: combobox to retrieve the cost/profit center (already present in the cost/profit center table).

**Percentage%**: percentage attribution of cost or revenue to that center (for example, if the cost needs to be divided 50% on two centers, enter two rows, one for each center with a percentage of 50%).

**Division**: combobox to retrieve the business division of reference for the link being inserted.

**Starting validity date**: mandatory field that indicates the date from which the link is valid.

**Expiration Date**: indicates the date from which the link is no longer valid.
