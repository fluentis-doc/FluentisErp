In order for the Conai expense to be applied in purchase or sale, the supplier/customer must be set up correctly in their registry. In particular:

**Recycle partner type**: this should indicate the role of the customer/supplier in the packaging supply chain in Italy among:
- A – Self-producer: refers to a company that produces packaging for its own use and uses it to package its own products. In other words, it does not sell packaging to others but uses it directly in its production or distribution activities.
- U1 – Merchant/Distributor: this is a company that purchases packaging from manufacturers or other merchants and resells it, without directly using it to package products. This role is typical of wholesalers or distributors of packaging.
- U2 – Other Users: includes all other categories of packaging users that do not specifically fall into the self-producer or merchant/distributor categories. These users may be companies that purchase packaging to use it in packaging products for sale, but do not produce them directly.
- P – Producer: this code identifies the company that produces packaging and sells it to others, who may be users or distributors.

:::note
For the calculation in purchase, the supplier must be P - Producer.
