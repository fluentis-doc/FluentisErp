In this section, ***FluentisERP*** stores the valuation logic of the electronic documents received from the agent via Sdi, in order to create *Professional Fees (Compensi professionisti)* rather than *Ledger Records*.

For each type of data required at the regulatory level, we will associate the corresponding valid value for the supplier in use.
