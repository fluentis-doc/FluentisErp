In this form, agents who commercially manage the subject in use are entered, whose registries have been previously created to be selectable in this tab.

There can therefore be multiple agents, both because there may be an agent and a sales manager earning commission on the same item, and because they may follow different brands and models, so depending on the sold item, there may be a single reference agent.

In the percentage field, it is possible to indicate a commission percentage for the agent (refer to the agent registry section for details on possible commission calculation combinations). There are also start and end dates for validity to check the validity of the relationship between the agent and the client, regardless of the validity of the agent's registry; for example, the agent may always be valid and active but has ceased the relationship with a certain client.

In the **Document visibility** field, when the agent has been granted access to ***Fluentis***, it can be defined whether the agent sees *All documents* of the client or only their *Own documents*.
