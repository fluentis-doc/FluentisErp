This form allows you to define the list of delivery destinations and the standard features of the related commercial clauses.

**Recipients list**: in the grid, different goods recipients can be indicated, including one default recipient to propose in the documents. If the location indicated in the ‘Common Data’ of the registry is the shipping location, it is not necessary to specify anything in these recipient/destination sections.

For each recipient, you can link the **Zone** and the **Delivery zone** references.

**Destinations list**: in the grid, the N possible destinations for that recipient are entered, which in turn can have a default value to propose, a default *Motorvehicle*, a *type of unit load*, a *delivery zone*, and a *Carrier*. You can then create a *triangulation*: selling to the subject in the registry and delivering to a particular warehouse of a third-party recipient.

In the lower section, you can define the **Type of Shipping** (land/sea/truck, etc.) and any notes, the type of *packaging* and any *notes*, and the delivery terms in the field *port* and any *notes* (all note fields, if filled, will be included in the shipping documents);

In the **Delivery Zones** section, there are default elements valid for the customer such as:

- **General delivery zone**: where you specify the general delivery zone and the address;

- **Exclusion Day/Delivery Day**: in this case, you specify the default delivery day for that zone; if the Exclusion Day flag is active, the indicated day will instead be the only day on which deliveries should never be made in that zone;

- **Exclusion Hour/Delivery Hour**: in this field, you specify the time range within which delivery must be made; if the Exclusion Delivery Hour flag is active, the indicated time range will instead be the range in which deliveries will not be accepted.

- **Employees number** needed for delivery;

- **Motorvehicle** dedicated to delivery;

- **Type of Loading Unit** (pallet, euro-pallet, etc.);

You can also specify if the transport is normally the responsibility of the **Sender**, **Recipient**, or the **Carrier**.

In the adjacent grid, it will be possible to indicate a **List of Authorized Carriers** for that subject, indicating one default carrier.

*Specific buttons*:
> **Save**: to save changes to the active registry.  
> **New recipient/New destination**: to manage the creation of a new non-accounting registry to automatically associate with the active registry as a recipient, as a destination, or both (if a recipient is selected, the creation of a destination will be proposed; in other cases, the creation of a new recipient will be proposed). The mask that opens allows you to define how to associate the creating registry with the active one, and to define all the characteristics of a new contact. It is possible to save the creation and continue entering new recipients/destinations, or press save with the mask closure to return to the active registry.  
> **Delete Recipient**: to delete the selected recipient.  
> **Delete Destination**: to delete the selected destination.  
> **Delete Carrier**: to delete the selected carrier.
