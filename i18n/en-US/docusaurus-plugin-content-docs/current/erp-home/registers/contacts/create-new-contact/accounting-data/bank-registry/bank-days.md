In this form, you can associate the currency days with the related accounting reasons, in order to automate the calculation of the bank value date in accounting movements (if the accounting reasons themselves involve the management of bank days).

The **Working** option requires assessing whether the day is a working day or a holiday (also taking into account the Holiday table defined for the company in Home>Utilities>Annual Holidays).

:::note Note
The selected reason must be enabled to display the data related to the Bank value date.

In this way, the data can be viewed within the accounting entry that uses the reason in question and refers to the bank that has the active setting.
