In this tab, it is possible to define the grouping parameters to use for the contact. In each row, a Fluentis procedure is reported that allows for grouping. Based on the flags set for each row, the various documents will be created according to the grouping rules. When creating a new registry, these parameters are populated with default values.      
The flag *Summary* is essential for creating a single document from multiple starting documents. The other flags pertain to specific groupings.      
In general, during the procedures, documents can be grouped by: document type, year, month, exchange rate, order, project, payment type and solution, destination, item 62, co-holders.
