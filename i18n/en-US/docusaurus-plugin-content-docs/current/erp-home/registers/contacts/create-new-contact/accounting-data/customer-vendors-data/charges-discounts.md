This form is dedicated to the entry of predefined expense types for the customer/supplier.

**Predefined charges typology**: in this grid, valid expenses for the customer/supplier are entered according to the default settings in the corresponding table (under *Configuration > Tables > General Settings > Expense Types*) and the specific values. The flag **Minimum spend value** indicates that the indicated expense is the minimum, if expressed as a percentage.

**Predefined discount types**: the grid allows defining discounts to always apply to the documents of the customer/supplier by selecting them from those preset in the corresponding table under *Configuration > Tables > General Settings > Discount Types*. It will be possible to establish priorities in case multiple discounts are present.

*Specific buttons*:  
> **Cancel Charges**: to delete the selected expenses.  
> **Delete discounts**: to delete the selected discounts.  
> **Delete Travel Expenses**: to delete the selected travel expenses. This cannot be active in a supplier registry as travel expenses are not managed.
