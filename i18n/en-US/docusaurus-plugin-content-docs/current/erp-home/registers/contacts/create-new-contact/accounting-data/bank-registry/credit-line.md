In this tab, the castelletti for bank effect presentations are indicated, distinctly for the types "**Subject to collection**," "**For discount**," and for the **Advance** on invoices (selecting the **Differentiated** mode) or a single global castelletto (selecting the **Global** mode).

The value of the granted castelletto is entered by the user based on the existing banking conditions, while the value of the used castelletto, and therefore the remainder, will be automatically updated by Fluentis based on the effect presentation manifests related to the bank of the registry in use and managed in the *Treasury* module.
