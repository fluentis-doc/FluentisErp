This window corresponds to the Payments window in the customer/supplier registry.

Here, however, only one type of payment and one payment solution (Home > Tables > General) with the standard banking references linked are set up.

**Payment sub-account**: this sub-account is associated with the accounting entries created, in order to verify the channeling of payments/receipts in the aging reports and in cash flow simulations.

In the grid below, there is a list of the agent's alternative supporting banks.

*Specific button*:
> **Delete Bank**: to delete the selected supporting bank.
