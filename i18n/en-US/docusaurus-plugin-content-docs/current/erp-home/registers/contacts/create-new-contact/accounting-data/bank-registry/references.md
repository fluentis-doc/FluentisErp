The bank registry presents in the **References** tab the fundamental data related to the bank account to indicate:

**ISO**: indicate the first 4 characters of the IBAN, then 2 characters for the country code (e.g., IT) + 2 for the institution code;

The **ABI**, **CAB** codes, the **C/C** number (for Italian banks, you must indicate 5 characters for abi and cab - including the leading zero - and all 12 characters of the Italian current account), the international **Swift** code, the **CIN**;

**Currency**: specify the currency in which the bank account is expressed;

It is possible to enter some useful data for the interaction with **DocFinanceÂ®** (external treasury program to the system):

**R.B.N.:** represents the type of relationship (e.g., Current account, currency account...);

**Doc Finance Bank**: the name of the bank to be used for bank flow analysis and other functions permitted by DocFinance;

**Bank code**: any free bank code;

**SIA**: code for sending Italian telematic files, e.g., for Bank Receipts (if not indicated, the default one entered in the Company table is used, Home>Tables>General);

**Presentation bank** allows linking the bank registry to the related code of the generic [**supporting bank**](/docs/configurations/tables/general-settings/reference-bank). This can be useful for automatically channeling financial movements of debtors and evaluating them in cash flow analyses.
