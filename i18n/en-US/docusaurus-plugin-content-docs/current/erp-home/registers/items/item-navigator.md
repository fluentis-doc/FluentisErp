The form opens through the path **Home > Items > Item Navigator (Home > Articoli > Navigatore articoli)** and allows viewing all the main information linked to items/customers necessary for quickly retrieving information and monitoring the situation without the need to enter each individual form.

The window is very similar to the item entry/view window, with the difference that there is only the possibility to view the data and not modify it. It consists of a first filtering section, where you can enter the item you want to analyze, and/or the customer you want to examine, or you can also specify the batch and/or the variant.

Once the filtering section is completed, clicking the **Search** button located in the ribbon bar of the form will display the requested results in the results grid.

For each item, you will see the information divided through the following tabs:
 - **Items**: in this tab, the demographic characteristics of the item are displayed.
 - **Availability**: in this tab, the availability of that item on the date you decide to set is briefly displayed, whether summary or not, and for which sections (work account, warehouse, purchases, sales, planned and released production); the results will be displayed in the two underlying grids according to the same logic explained in the article related to the [Availability Analysis](/docs/erp-home/registers/items/availability-analysis).
