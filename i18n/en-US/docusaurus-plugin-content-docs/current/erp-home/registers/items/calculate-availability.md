:::important What it is for
The Calculate Availability of Fluentis is an essential tool that enables users to accurately determine the availability of items within warehouses. This functionality is accessible through a user-friendly interface, where users can select the warehouses on which they wish to perform the calculation. The user can enter information such as the warehouse code and its description, thus configuring the basis for operation.

In the section dedicated to the calculation, users can set the criteria for both physical and logical availability, specifying whether to consider documents related to purchases, sales, planned and released productions. Additionally, it is possible to establish a specific time frame for which the calculation should be carried out, thus increasing the accuracy of the collected data.

This functionality not only facilitates inventory monitoring but also supports strategic real-time decisions, ensuring that companies can promptly respond to procurement and sales needs. Thanks to the availability calculation, Fluentis therefore offers a significant competitive advantage, optimizing inventory management and improving operational efficiency.

The window related to the availability calculation opens through the path **Home > Items > Calculate Availability (Home > Articoli > Calcolo disponibilità)**.

Through this form, users enter the warehouses for which they wish to calculate availability, and these will subsequently be reported in the form [Availability Analysis](/docs/erp-home/registers/items/availability-analysis).

The form consists of a grid, where the **Warehouse** code and the corresponding **Description** are entered for all the warehouses for which availability calculation is desired (by adding or removing a warehouse within this grid, it will be added or removed from the warehouse grid present in the *Availability Analysis*).

In the section on the right, the types of **Physical Calculate Availability (Calcolo della disponibilità fisica)** and **Logical Availability (Disponibilità logica)** can be set for: accounts/work, purchases, sales, planned production, released production, and warehouse (one, some, or all of these options can be chosen, which may differ between physical availability and logical availability).

Lastly, there is the possibility to indicate the period that the system should consider for the availability calculation, entering from today's date (i.e., the date the availability analysis is launched) the **Number of days (Numero dei giorni)** for which the system must check the availability within documents.

Currently, these fields are no longer managed because they have been implemented within the Availability Analysis screen. The only part still active remains the grid of Warehouses.

Once the parameters have been set, users can proceed to the [Availability Analysis](/docs/erp-home/registers/items/availability-analysis) through the *Availability Analysis printing*Print Report*Analisi disponibilità*).
