:::important What it is for (A cosa serve)
The Variants tab in the Fluentis item registry provides the functionality to enter and manage the variants of a given item. This option is particularly useful when there is a need to create a new item that differs only marginally from an existing one. In such cases, creating a variant is preferable to creating a new item, especially when the main characteristics of the original item remain substantially unchanged.        
A practical example of this functionality can be observed in the fashion sector: one might have an item called "sweater," from which variants are created for different sizes and colors, maintaining the fundamental characteristics of the original item.

The tab is structured into two grids: the first contains the details of the variants, such as code, description, minimum and maximum stock, reorder point, stock days, average cost, and selling price. This information differentiates each variant from the main item. In the second grid, if available, a specific barcode for the variant can also be entered.

In summary, the Variants tab represents a powerful tool for managing minor differences between similar items, facilitating the logging and administration of inventories.
:::

In this tab, you can enter and/or view the variants of a given item. Sometimes, if a new item that needs to be created is very similar to an existing one and differs only by a minor characteristic that does not significantly impact the information present in the various tabs of the existing item, in this case, you will not create a new item but simply create variants of that item.

An *example* can be taken from the fashion sector: you enter the item sweater and then create variants for size and color, but the main characteristics of the sweater remain the same.

The tab consists of two grids. In the first grid, the variant is entered with information related to code and description, minimum and maximum stock, reorder point and the corresponding days, stock days, and finally the selling price, average cost, last cost, and standard cost.

The information found in the grid is the only information that differentiates the variant from the main item; for all the information not present in the grid, you will rely on that present in the various tabs of that item.

In the lower grid, you can also enter, if available, the specific barcode of that variant.
