**Introduction**: [Product identification and related parts](/docs/erp-home/registers/items/master-item-intro) 

:::important Purpose
The item registry of Fluentis plays a crucial role in managing and organizing information related to a companyâ€™s items. It acts as a central database where the details of each product are recorded and updated, allowing for a clear and systematic view of inventories, costs, and warehouse movements.

The information contained in the item registry includes identifying details such as the item code, description, unit of measure, and supplier information. Additionally, it is possible to enter data regarding prices, procurement policies, and batch management, facilitating daily operations of purchasing, selling, and logistics.

Thanks to this registry, companies can keep track of the status of items, automate processes such as restocking inventory, and obtain detailed reports for more effective purchasing planning. Furthermore, integration with other Fluentis modules allows for better coordination of warehouse activities, improving operational efficiency and contributing to more accurate and timely inventory management.

The process of creating a new item opens through the path:
- **Home > Item > Create New Item**,

or

- **Home > Items > Search Items** by clicking the **New** button present in the ribbon bar of the form in question.

The **Item registry** form will open, consisting of a section where the *mandatory characteristics* of the item will be defined and a lower section made up of several tabs that group the *specific characteristics*.

The fundamental and mandatory characteristics that each item must have and that we find in the first part of the form are: the [**Class**](/docs/guide/common/glossary/glossary-intro#item-class) (maximum 3 characters), the [**Code**](/docs/guide/common/glossary/glossary-intro#item-code) (maximum 50 characters), a brief **Description**, and the [**Units of Measure**](/docs/guide/common/glossary/glossary-intro#unit-of-measurement).

:::note
The combination of class and code must be unique for that specific item.
:::
Other non-mandatory characteristics:
- **Second description**: a second description that can be attributed to the item;
- **Configuration/Version**: combo through which the version of the item is selected;

Once all the mandatory characteristics of the item have been defined, one proceeds to enter the more specific ones through the various tabs found in the second part of the window, which are covered in the following documents.

*Specific buttons*  

> **Update LF LV with Formula**: button that allows updating selling prices through specific formulas starting from the list prices;      
> [**MRP Parameters**](/docs/configurations/parameters/production/mrp-parameters/search-mrp-parameters): button that provides access to the *MRP Parameters* of that item, where parameters necessary for managing that item in production are defined; this is a button that will also be found within other forms related to the production area.  

For everything that is not detailed in this document regarding the common functioning of the forms, please refer to the following link [Common functionalities, buttons, and fields](/docs/guide/common).
