Within this tab, it is possible to enter alternative codes also known as barcode codes that represent the item.

Barcode codes are barcodes that contain some of the main information related to the encoding of the item to which they are associated and are useful for warehouse operations. These codes are read through specific devices called Mobile using laser beams or LED bars.

Barcodes can come in various types. 
The two types managed by the database are:
- EAN13 (means that the barcode can have a maximum length of 13 characters)     
- EAN128 (means that the barcode must have an even number of digits).

In **Fluentis ERP**, there are no pre-defined parameters that indicate how to set the barcode so that it complies with the regulations related to EAN13 and 128, but custom algorithms can be applied that adhere to the standard and check the barcode being entered to ensure it complies with the aforementioned regulations.

The form consists of a grid where a **New** barcode can be entered using the **Insert** button present in the ribbon bar, or by going directly to a new row.

In the **Barcode type** field, you select, using the corresponding dropdown, the type of barcode you want to encode and in the **Barcode** field, the barcode code.

*Specific buttons (Pulsanti specifici)*:

> **Validation**: pressing this button, the system checks that the code corresponds to the regulations mentioned earlier regarding the length that the code must have based on the type of code being entered;
> **Delete Barcodes (Cancella codici barcode)**: allows you to delete a previously entered barcode.
