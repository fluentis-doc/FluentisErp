This tab allows you to associate images with the item.

Through the **Add image** button, it is possible to insert an image within the tab.

This procedure is not commonly used as there is a function [**Attach Documents (Allega documenti)**](/docs/guide/common/common-buttons#document-manager) present in every form that allows you to attach various types of documents, including images.
