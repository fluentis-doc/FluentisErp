**Introduction**: [Identification of products and their parts](/docs/erp-home/registers/items/master-item-intro) 

:::important Purpose
The item registry filter in Fluentis is a key function that allows you to search for, view, and manage items within the system.     
Organized into a section for entering search criteria and a grid for the results, it enables targeted searches through various parameters such as code, class, merchandise category, or supplier.       
More advanced searches can also be performed, for example, to identify items that are running out or archived, improving efficiency in inventory management.
:::

It allows for searching all items with the aim of viewing, modifying, and potentially deleting them or proceeding to insert a new item; the window consists of a filter area and a results grid.

With the help of filters, you can choose to display: a single item (e.g., by searching with the *Item code*), or multiple items belonging to the same class by entering the *Item class*; items with the same characteristics, or the same *Product category* (e.g., by searching with characteristic and merchandise category); items with the same *Part type*, or the same *Nomenclature*; all items having the same *Preferential vendor*, the same *State* or *Version*; in the case of purchased materials, it is possible to search for the item using the *supplier item code*.

You can also use **Advance search** by opening the relevant combo, where you can add further flags that allow you to further filter items by displaying only out-of-stock, archived, or fictitious items.  
The **Batches and Serial Number** section allows us to filter by displaying only items managed in batches, or only those managed by serial numbers or unique RFID.

We will detail the explanation of these flags as we analyze the various tabs that compose each item in their respective documentation articles, in which their relative characteristics are indicated.

Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results in the results grid.

To open the details of an item, simply select it and double-click with the mouse, or click the **Modify** button (allows you to enter and modify details) or the **View** button (allows you to enter and view details but not modify them).

*Specific buttons*:

> **New**: this button allows you to create a new item;  
> **Massive change**: this button allows you, after selecting a series of items that need the same modification, to enter and apply it in bulk, without having to modify one item at a time.
