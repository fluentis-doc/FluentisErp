In this form, it is possible to define some parameters useful for executing the printing of the Chart of Accounts.

**Group**: this combo box allows you to filter only certain groups of accounts to be printed.

Please note that to select more than one group at a time, the rows in the combo box must be selected while holding down the **Ctrl** key.

**From Account / To Account**: these fields allow you to filter a pair of accounts to print only a portion of the chart of accounts.

Flag **Info do not visualize**: Allows you to exclude from the printout (with the active flags) the detail accounts related to the records of customers/suppliers, agents, and banks.

After defining the desired parameters, press the Preview or Print button to print directly.
