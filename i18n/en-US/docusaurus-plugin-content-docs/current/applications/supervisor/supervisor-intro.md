*Supervisor* is a tool that allows us to create scripts that can be executed programmatically. In particular *Supervisor* is composed by three core components (they are not necessarily used together), which are:  
**Activity** (i.e. script of different types created by the user), **Task** (i.e. a sort of container that store single or multiple **activity**/ies), **Event** (i.e. scheduled actions). 

*Supervisor* application opens via the right side complementary menu **Tools** > **Fluentis Supervisor**.

:::caution
The *Supervisor* application will be visibile in the complementary applications menu only if the **Fluentis Universal** menu is selected.
