The *Activity* has been created to solve a complexity problem linked to the previous version of *Fluentis* and therefore reduce the skills required by the potential user (it was decided to divide the problem into blocks).
The *Activity* can be seen as an atomic unit, or an element with a series of input and output parameters, which is analyzed and then divided into types (that they will be described later in this document). 

The **Activity** form opens via the path **Application > Supervisor > Activities**.

Some of the functionalities inside the form refer to a standard use, therefore for anything not detailed in this document on the standard functions of the form, refer to the following link [functionalities, buttons and common entries](/docs/guide/common).

The activities displayed are organized in groups (e.g. *Examples, Utilities, Demo*) by context of use. A new group of activities can be created, refer to the following link [group creation](../../group-creation) for more.
