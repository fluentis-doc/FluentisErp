An *Event* is a functionality of *Supervisor* that allows the user to execute a selected *Task* based on a schedule.

The **Event** form opens via the path **Application > Supervisor > Events**.

Some of the functionalities inside the form refer to a standard use, therefore for anything not detailed in this document on the standard functions of the form, refer to the following link [functionalities, buttons and common entries](/docs/guide/common).

The *Events* are organized in groups (e.g. *Examples, Demo*) by context of use. A new group of *Events* can be created, refer to the following link [group creation](../../group-creation) for more.
