Within the [Event](event-intro) main *Form* are displayed some relevant data regarding the *Event* execution (comes handy because opening the *Object Form* is not needed). In particular inside the main *Form*'s grid there are *Last Execution Result* and *Maximum Duration* fields and it's possibile to view detailed information about the *Event* execution (errors, informations and logs) by clicking on the row and then expanding it.
