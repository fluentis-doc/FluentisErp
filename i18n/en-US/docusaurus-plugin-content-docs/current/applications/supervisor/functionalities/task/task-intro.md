In order to use the *Activities* you need a container, in this case, a **Task**. When a *Task* is created the script attached to it, is partially filled with some default code, necessary in order for the *Task* to work; the user has the possibility to add more code to the attached script, by using the *Script Editor* or the codeless platform *Blockly*.

The **Task** form opens via the path **Application > Supervisor > Tasks**.

Some of the functionalities inside the form refer to a standard use, therefore for anything not detailed in this document on the standard functions of the form, refer to the following link [functionalities, buttons and common entries](/docs/guide/common).

The *Tasks* appeared are organized in groups (e.g. *Examples, Demo*) by context of use. A new group of *Tasks* can be created, refer to the following link [group creation](../../group-creation) for more.
