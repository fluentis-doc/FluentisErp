:::info
Once opened the object form, located inside the filter widget (i.e. over the tabs), there are more/less standard parameters - such as *Code, Description, Creation Date, Last edit date* - the ones you need to pay more attention to are *Creation User, Editing User* and to the optional parameter *Linked Distribution List* (the latter refers to the CRM list).
:::

In this tab members can be added using the grid and there is no *Object Widget* that controls what the user inputed, except for the field *Linked User*; it will be inputed arbitrary by the user based of its necessities.
