To make reusable some values, there is the possibility to use them as general parameters, that means make them visibile across some *Supervisor* functionalities (i.e. *Activities* and *Tasks*). 

To create a new general parameter, open the **General Parameters** form via the path **Configuration > Parameters > Supervisor > General Parameters**.
All the functionalities inside the form refer to a standard use, therefore for anything not detailed in this document on the standard functions of the form, refer to the following link [functionalities, buttons and common entries](/docs/guide/common).
