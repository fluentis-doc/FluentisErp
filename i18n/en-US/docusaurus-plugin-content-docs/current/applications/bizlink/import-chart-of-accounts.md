The Excel sheet (template) for importing the chart of accounts in the Administration module allows populating the detailed part of the chart of accounts.

**Therefore, the structure part (groups) must already be present in the upper grid of the chart of accounts form.**

**Group Level Columns (1, 2, 3, 4, 5):** In these columns, enter the codes for the various levels and sub-levels (up to five) where the accounts to be imported are to be placed. 

WARNING, existing groups are searched for; the import does not create new groups.

**Account / Detail account / Description:** enter the code for the account and sub-account, as well as the description to be imported (in this case, the account / sub-account will be created with the code entered).

**Description 2:** it is possible to also fill in the second description (Optional) for the new account.

**Account Type:** fill in with the code of one of the account types already present in Fluentis to assign it to the new account that is being created.
