**BizLink** allows the operator to configure and monitor data import and export flows to and from other external systems to the management software.

It is indeed thanks to this **ESB (Enterprise Service Bus)** application that **Fluentis** has been able to standardize all interactions with other external procedures, both for the import and export of data, but especially for consuming external processes from other applications.

Through this procedure, **BizLink** makes it very easy to configure the reading of any CSV, TXT, XML file, and various other formats, in order to interpret, read, and/or also write those files. All of this is tracked in appropriate **LOGs of Entry and Exit** of the information to give the operator visibility on whether an import or export process has been successful or not.

Also in **BizLink**, we find the area of **OnDemand Imports**, very useful for all companies that need to import data, especially during the initial product setup phase. In fact, it is through the OnDemand imports area, more specifically from *spreadsheet*, that by activating this procedure, it is possible to easily import and update the basic archives such as Items, Bills of Materials, Cycles, Customers, Suppliers, etc., and even documents such as orders, invoices, price lists, etc.

The module is accessible from the **Fluentis** sidebar via the following path [**Tools** > **BizLink**].

More information about the functioning of the module can be found in the following articles.
