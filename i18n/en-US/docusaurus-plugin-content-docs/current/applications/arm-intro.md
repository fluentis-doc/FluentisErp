Application Resource Manager, hereafter also referred to as the acronym **ARM**, allows for the configuration of applications and the access parameters of applications at the database and user level.

It defines the standard and customized application menus for roles/users. It also establishes restrictions and access rights to each individual procedure and functionality of the application.

Regarding application development, ARM is the tool that allows for the consultation, management, and creation of business objects that are usable and used by the applications.

For details, refer to the *complete documentation of the ARM application* available [**here (qui)**](https://docs.fluentis.com/Arm/).
