The **Tools** panel contains the list of applications that can be configured and managed within **Fluentis ERP**.

Thus, we have quick access commands to manage the application's resources, for example, user and restriction management, although generally, those who configure these parameters usually operate through a web portal, the [**ARM**](https://docs.fluentis.com/Arm/) portal, specific for these purposes.
