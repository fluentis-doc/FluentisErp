The **Opportunity Progress Kan Ban Board** procedure aims to graphically display, using the Kan Ban methodology, the **Opportunities** entered in Fluentis divided by the **probability of success percentages** of those opportunities. With the help of filters, you can view: a single type of opportunity (**Opportunity Type**), multiple opportunities entered by the same user (**User**), and multiple opportunities with the same probability of success (**Probability progress**).

The filter area is dedicated to hosting the list of possible data types that allow for selection. The filters are typically in an 'AND' condition, and it is possible to specify multiple simultaneous filter criteria.

In the area below the filter, the **Kan Ban Board** is present, where opportunities are displayed divided by probability of success percentages. Each column of the Kan Ban Board is composed of the following elements:

A **top band** where the following data is displayed in order:
- % of probability of success;
- Count: corresponds to the number of opportunities that are placed in that column;
- Total Net Amount: corresponds to the total value of the opportunities present in the column, net of applied discounts.

A **bottom band** where the individual opportunities are displayed. For each opportunity, the following data is shown in order:
- Name of the contact associated with the opportunity;
- Title of the opportunity;
- Fluentis user who entered the opportunity;
- Stage of the Pipeline Flux in which the opportunity is located;
- Total net of the opportunity.

By double-clicking on the individual opportunity, you enter the view/edit mode of that opportunity.
