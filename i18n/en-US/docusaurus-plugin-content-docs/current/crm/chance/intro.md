The module allows for integrated management of commercial negotiations. It enables monitoring of the sales cycle in a structured manner, starting from the initial lead generation phase to the closing of the negotiation. Opportunities are used to gather relevant information regarding potential customers, linking this information to other business areas, such as marketing.         
From a technical standpoint, opportunities allow for tracking every interaction with the customer, linking it to specific documents, quotes, and planned activities. The data collected through this module is used to generate sales forecasts based on statistical and probabilistic parameters. Additionally, it integrates workflow management functionalities to automate certain steps in the sales process and provide real-time notifications on changes in the status of the opportunity.         

**Opportunity**       
The Opportunities module of Fluentis ERP allows for managing the entire lifecycle of a sales opportunity, from creation to closure.       

**Crm opportunity map**       
This feature provides a geographical visualization of active opportunities, using the geographical information present in the CRM contact registry. Opportunities can be filtered by type, operator user, or probability of success.     

**Opportunity Progress KanBan Board**     
This function displays opportunities divided by probability of success, using a KanBan Board. Through advanced filters, it is possible to isolate specific sets of opportunities, with columns representing different success percentages. Each column shows the number of opportunities, their total net value, and individual details for each opportunity.       

**Opportunity Stages KanBan Board**      
Similar to the previous one, this feature divides opportunities by workflow stages. Each column of the KanBan Board represents a stage of the workflow, with information on the number and net value of opportunities.      

**Invoicing Progress Kanban Board**       
This procedure allows for monitoring the status of opportunities, orders, and invoices over a defined period of time, divided by months. Documents can be viewed aggregated or individually, with economic details and links for direct editing.
