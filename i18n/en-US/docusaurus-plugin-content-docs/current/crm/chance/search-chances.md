The Opportunities module allows the operator to manage the opportunities related to CRM contacts. Opportunities refer to negotiations that are either ongoing or potential for the contact.

The **Opportunities Search** procedure is designed to allow the user to easily search for already entered CRM opportunities, with the purpose of viewing, modifying, and possibly deleting them. With the help of filters, one can view: a single opportunity (**Number**), multiple opportunities of the same type (**Opportunity Type**), or multiple opportunities with the same probability of success (**Probability progress**).

Refer to the [Common Features](/docs/guide/common/operations-with-data/view-modify-save-and-delete-data) for the buttons present in the **Ribbon bar**.

The **filter area (area di filtro)** is dedicated to hosting the list of possible data types through which a selection can be made. Filters are typically in an 'AND' condition, and it is possible to specify multiple filter criteria simultaneously.

The main filters are **Opportunity Type**, the **Number** of the opportunity, and the **Contact** to which the opportunity is linked.

The **result grid (griglia di risultato)** represents the list of opportunities that match the above-specified filter data. After specifying the values through which the user wishes to conduct an opportunity search, pressing the button ![Search (Ricerca)](/img/neutral/common/search.png) present in the corresponding Ribbon will return the desired list of opportunities in the result grid. Within the grid, the user can view the main characteristics of each Opportunity.
