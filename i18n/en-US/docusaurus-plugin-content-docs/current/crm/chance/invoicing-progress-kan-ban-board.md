---

This procedure aims to visualize (using the Kan Ban methodology) Opportunities, Orders, and Invoices for specific periods. The procedure consists of two tabs: **Filter** and **Results**.

### Filter     

In this tab, it is necessary to enter the filters to be used for visualizing the results in the next tab.     
In the first part, the following flags are present: *Collapse sales invoices*, *Collapse sales orders*, *Collapse opportunities*; by entering these flags, we want to view the total amounts of orders, opportunities, and invoices; without these flags, the various documents will be displayed separately, each with its own values.      
The **Company** filter is mandatory and contains the company to refer to.     
The **Month interval** filter indicates, with quarterly intervals, the period to be considered.    
The **Agent** filter allows you to view the documents that all have the same associated agent;     
The **Currency** filter is automatically populated.        
There are also the filters *Opportunity*, *Sales invoice*, *Sales Order*: these flags set which documents to display among the results.     
Finally, there are sections to insert filters respectively for Opportunities, Invoices, and Orders. In all three cases, the proposed Dates will depend on the previously entered monthly range.     

### Results    

In the tab, there is the **Kan Ban Board**, where documents are displayed divided by the various months entered in the filters.
Each column of the Kan Ban Board consists of the following elements:      
A **top band** where the following data is displayed, in order:
- reference month; 
- Count: corresponds to the number of opportunities/invoices/orders placed in that column;
- Total Net Amount: corresponds to the total value of opportunities/invoices/orders present in the column, net of applied discounts.     
  
A **bottom band** where various data of the individual documents are displayed.

By double-clicking, it is possible to open the connected document.
