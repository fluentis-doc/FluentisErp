This feature allows for a graphical visualization of the geographic distribution of **Opportunities** based on the geographic information indicated in the CRM contact registry present in the opportunities.

With the help of filters, you can view: a single type of opportunity (**Opportunity Type**), multiple opportunities entered by the same user (**User**), or multiple opportunities with the same probability of success (**Probability progress**).

The filter area is dedicated to hosting the list of possible data types through which it is possible to make a selection. The filters are typically in an 'AND' condition, and it is possible to specify multiple filtering criteria simultaneously.

In the area below the filter section, there is a map where opportunities are displayed, marked with an indicator within which you can view the number of opportunities present for the same Contact. 
Clicking on the indicator will display the following information in a pop-up window:

-	Company name of the contact holding the opportunity;
-	The contact quality;
-	The value of the opportunity;
-	The address of the Contact.
