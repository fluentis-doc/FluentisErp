This feature allows graphically visualizing the geographical distribution of **Opportunities** based on the geographic indications provided in the CRM contact records associated with the opportunities.

Using filters, you can view: a single type of opportunity (**Opportunity Type**), multiple opportunities entered by the same user (**Operator**), and multiple opportunities with the same success probability (**Success Probability**).

The filter area is dedicated to listing the potential data types for selection. Filters typically operate on an 'AND' condition, and you can specify multiple concurrent filtering criteria.

Below the filter area is the map displaying the opportunities, marked with indicators that show the number of opportunities associated with the same contact. Clicking on an indicator will show a pop-up window with the following information:

- Company Name of the contact who owns the opportunity;
- Contact's Quality;
- Opportunity Value;
- Contact's Address.
