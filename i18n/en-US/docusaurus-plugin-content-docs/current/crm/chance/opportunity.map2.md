This feature allows you to visually display the geographical distribution of **Opportunities** based on the geographical indications provided in the CRM contacts' records associated with the opportunities.

With the help of filters, you can display: a single type of opportunity (**Opportunity Type**), multiple opportunities entered by the same user (**Operator**), or multiple opportunities with the same success probability (**Success Probability**).

The filter area is dedicated to listing the possible data types for selection. The filters typically use 'AND' conditions, and you can specify multiple concurrent filter criteria.

Below the filter area, you will find the map displaying the opportunities, indicated by markers that show the number of opportunities associated with the same Contact. Clicking on the marker will display the following information in a popup window:

- Company Name of the contact linked to the opportunity;
- Contact Quality;
- Opportunity Value;
- Contact Address.
