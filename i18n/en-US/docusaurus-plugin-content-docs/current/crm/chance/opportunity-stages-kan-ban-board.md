The **Opportunity Stages Kan Ban Board** procedure aims to graphically display, using the Kan Ban methodology, the opportunities entered in Fluentis divided by the stages of the workflow associated with those opportunities. The workflow to consider must be inserted in the filters.     
With the help of the filters, you can view: a single type of opportunity (**Opportunity Type**), multiple opportunities entered by the same user (**User**), and multiple opportunities with the same probability of success (**Probability progress**).

The filter area is dedicated to hosting the list of possible data types that allow for selection. The filters are typically in 'AND' condition, and it is possible to specify multiple filter criteria simultaneously.

In the area below the filter area is the **Kan Ban Board**, where opportunities are displayed divided by the various stages of the workflow selected in the filters. Each column of the Kan Ban Board consists of the following elements:  

A **top band** where the following data are displayed, in order:
- Workflow stage (Stadio del workflow);
- Count: corresponds to the number of opportunities placed in that column;
- Total Net Amount: corresponds to the total value of the opportunities present in the column, net of applied discounts.

A **bottom band** where individual opportunities are displayed. For each opportunity, the following data are displayed in order:
- Name of the contact person for the opportunity (Nome del contatto intestatario dell’opportunità);
- Title of the opportunity (Titolo dell’opportunità);
- Fluentis user who entered the opportunity (Utente Fluentis che ha inserito l’opportunità);
- Net total of the opportunity (Totale netto dell’opportunità).

By double-clicking on a single opportunity, you enter the view/edit mode of that opportunity.
