Managing newsletters in Fluentis is a feature designed to facilitate direct and targeted communication with clients and other business contacts. This function allows you to create, manage, and send email marketing campaigns using the data present in the management system. Below is an explanation of what it is for and how it can be used.

**Creation and Management of Newsletter Campaigns (Creazione e Gestione delle Campagne Newsletter)**  
The newsletter management functionality allows for creating customized email marketing campaigns. Users can configure the contents of newsletters (defining text, images, links, and other relevant information to communicate with recipients) by creating different [Templates (Template)](/docs/crm/budget-marketing-automation/template/template-search).

**Segmentation of Recipients (Segmentazione dei Destinatari)**  
It is possible to segment recipients precisely by selecting specific groups of contacts and then creating different [Distribution Lists (Liste di distribuzione)](/docs/crm/budget-marketing-automation/distribution-list/distribution-list-search). This allows for sending highly targeted communications, increasing the effectiveness of campaigns.

**Automation and Scheduling of Sends (Automazione e Programmazione degli Invii)**  
Fluentis's newsletter management supports automation, allowing for the scheduling of email sends at specific times. This is useful for coordinating campaigns with particular events, such as the launch of new products, seasonal promotions, or business updates. Additionally, automatic sends can be configured with the passage of status in workflows.

**Integration with the CRM (Integrazione con il CRM)**  
Newsletter management in Fluentis is closely integrated with [CRM Contacts (Contatti CRM)](/docs/crm/home-crm/contacts/search-contacts). This allows for centralized management of all customer interactions, including newsletter sends, and enriching the customer profile with information from marketing activities.

Thus, newsletter management in the Fluentis management system is a powerful tool for improving business communication, allowing for the sending of personalized and relevant messages to customers and contacts, all integrated into the company's operational flow. This functionality not only supports marketing activities but also helps maintain constant and fruitful contact with your audience, improving customer relationships and enhancing sales opportunities.
