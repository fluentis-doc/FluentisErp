The Newsletter search form allows you to search for newsletters already entered in Fluentis, as well as to insert new ones.

Newsletter management in Fluentis is a feature designed to facilitate direct and targeted communication with customers and other business contacts. This function allows you to create, manage, and send email marketing campaigns using the data present in the management system. Below it is explained what it is for and how it can be used.

**Creation and Management of Newsletter Campaigns (Creazione e Gestione delle Campagne Newsletter)**  
The newsletter management functionality allows you to create personalized email marketing campaigns. Users can configure the contents of the newsletters (defining text, images, links, and other relevant information to communicate with recipients) by creating different [Templates](/docs/crm/budget-marketing-automation/template/template-search).

**Segmentation of Recipients (Segmentazione dei Destinatari)**  
It is possible to precisely segment the recipients, selecting specific groups of contacts and thus creating different [Distribution Lists](/docs/crm/budget-marketing-automation/distribution-list/distribution-list-search). This allows for sending highly targeted communications, increasing the effectiveness of the campaigns.

**Automation and Scheduling of Sends (Automazione e Programmazione degli Invii)**  
Fluentis's newsletter management supports automation, allowing you to schedule the sending of emails at specific times. This is useful for coordinating campaigns with particular events, such as the launch of new products, seasonal promotions, or company updates. Additionally, it is possible to configure automatic sends even with status changes in workflows.

**Integration with the CRM (Integrazione con il CRM)**  
Newsletter management in Fluentis is closely integrated with [CRM Contacts](/docs/crm/home-crm/contacts/search-contacts). This allows for centralized management of all interactions with customers, including newsletter sends, and enriches the customer profile with information from marketing activities.

Therefore, newsletter management in the Fluentis management system is a powerful tool to enhance business communication, allowing personalized and relevant messages to be sent to clients and contacts, all integrated into the companyâ€™s operational flow. This functionality not only supports marketing activities but also helps maintain consistent and fruitful contact with the audience, improving customer relationships and enhancing sales opportunities.
