The Newsletter search mask allows you to search for newsletters already entered in Fluentis, as well as insert new ones.

The management of newsletters in Fluentis is a feature designed to facilitate direct and targeted communication with customers and other business contacts. This function allows you to create, manage, and send email marketing campaigns using the data present in the management system. Below, it is explained what it is used for and how it can be utilized.

**Creation and Management of Newsletter Campaigns**
The newsletter management functionality allows you to create personalized email marketing campaigns. Users can configure the contents of the newsletters (defining text, images, links, and other relevant information to communicate with recipients) by creating various [Templates](/docs/crm/budget-marketing-automation/template/template-search).

**Segmentation of Recipients**
It is possible to segment the recipients precisely, selecting specific groups of contacts and thus creating different [Distribution Lists](/docs/crm/budget-marketing-automation/distribution-list/distribution-list-search). This allows for highly targeted communications, increasing the effectiveness of campaigns.

**Automation and Scheduling of Sends**
Fluentis's newsletter management supports automation, allowing you to schedule the sending of emails at specific times. This is useful for coordinating campaigns with particular events, such as the launch of new products, seasonal promotions, or business updates. Furthermore, automatic sends can also be configured with the status change in workflows.

**Integration with CRM**
The management of newsletters in Fluentis is closely integrated with [CRM Contacts](/docs/crm/home-crm/contacts/search-contacts). This allows for centralized management of all interactions with customers, including newsletter sends, and enriches the customer profile with information from marketing activities.

Thus, managing newsletters in the Fluentis management system is a powerful tool for improving business communication, allowing for the sending of personalized and relevant messages to customers and contacts, all integrated into the companyâ€™s operational flow. This functionality not only supports marketing activities but also helps maintain constant and fruitful contact with the audience, improving the client relationship and enhancing sales opportunities.
