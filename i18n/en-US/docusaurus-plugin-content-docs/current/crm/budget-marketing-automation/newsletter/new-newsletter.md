To send the Newsletter, once the parameters shown previously are indicated, it is necessary to press the Send button ![](/img/neutral/common/send.png) present on the Ribbon bar. This will open the actual sending form of the Newsletter, which presents the tabs **Home**, **Insert**, and **Merge Data**, already present in the Document Template section (for more information, refer to the [Template](/docs/crm/budget-marketing-automation/template/new-template) section), along with the **Email** tab that presents the following functions:

**Print Report**: Button to perform the physical printing of the newsletter;  
**Print Preview**: Button to perform the print preview of the newsletter;

In the section below, some fields are present, some of which are carried over from the previous form:

**Recipients**: this field allows you to specify the email recipients by selecting them from the CRM contacts or from the users of Fluentis;

**Subject**: corresponds to what is usually called the Subject of the email;

**Mail Template**: used to select the [Template](/docs/crm/budget-marketing-automation/template/new-template);

**Cc**: used to indicate the email addresses that should receive the email in carbon copy;

**Bcc**: used to indicate the email addresses that should receive the email in blind carbon copy. Fluentis automatically fills this field with the email addresses of the Fluentis CRM contacts so that each recipient receiving the newsletter does not see the email addresses of other recipients;

**Embedded image**: checking this flag will mean that any images included in the template will not be inserted as attachments to the created email but as actual elements of the email;

**Attachments**: the files that will be attached to the Newsletter are displayed.
