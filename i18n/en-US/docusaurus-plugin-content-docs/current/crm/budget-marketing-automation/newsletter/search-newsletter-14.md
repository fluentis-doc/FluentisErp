The management of newsletters in Fluentis is a feature designed to facilitate direct and targeted communication with customers and other business contacts. This function allows you to create, manage, and send email marketing campaigns using data present in the management system. Below is an explanation of what it is for and how it can be used.

**Creation and Management of Newsletter Campaigns (Creazione e Gestione delle Campagne Newsletter)**  
The newsletter management functionality allows you to create personalized email marketing campaigns. Users can configure the content of the newsletters (defining text, images, links, and other relevant information to communicate with recipients) by creating different [Templates (Template)](/docs/crm/budget-marketing-automation/template/template-search).

**Segmentation of Recipients (Segmentazione dei Destinatari)**  
It is possible to segment recipients precisely, selecting specific groups of contacts and then creating different [Distribution Lists (Liste di distribuzione)](/docs/crm/budget-marketing-automation/distribution-list/distribution-list-search). This allows for highly targeted communications, increasing the effectiveness of campaigns.

**Automation and Scheduling of Sends (Automazione e Programmazione degli Invii)**  
Fluentis newsletter management supports automation, allowing the scheduling of email sends at specific times. This is useful for coordinating campaigns with particular events, such as the launch of new products, seasonal promotions, or business updates. Additionally, it is possible to configure automatic sends also with status changes in workflows.

**Integration with CRM (Integrazione con il CRM)**  
The management of newsletters in Fluentis is closely integrated with [CRM Contacts (Contatti CRM)](/docs/crm/home-crm/contacts/search-contacts). This allows for centralized management of all interactions with customers, including newsletter sends, and to enrich the customer's profile with information from marketing activities.

Managing newsletters in the Fluentis management system is therefore a powerful tool for improving business communication, enabling the sending of personalized and relevant messages to your customers and contacts, all integrated into the company's operational flow. This functionality not only supports marketing activities but also helps maintain a constant and fruitful contact with the audience, improving customer relationships and enhancing sales opportunities.
