The management of newsletters in Fluentis is a feature designed to facilitate direct and targeted communication with customers and other business contacts. This function allows you to create, manage, and send email marketing campaigns using the data available in the management system. Below, it is explained what it is used for and how it can be utilized.

**Creation and Management of Newsletter Campaigns (Creazione e Gestione delle Campagne Newsletter)**  
The newsletter management functionality allows the creation of customized email marketing campaigns. Users can configure the content of newsletters (defining text, images, links, and other relevant information to communicate with recipients) by creating different [Templates](/docs/crm/budget-marketing-automation/template/template-search).

**Segmentation of Recipients (Segmentazione dei Destinatari)**  
It is possible to segment recipients precisely by selecting specific groups of contacts and then creating various [Distribution Lists](/docs/crm/budget-marketing-automation/distribution-list/distribution-list-search). This enables sending highly targeted communications, increasing the effectiveness of the campaigns.

**Automation and Scheduling of Sends (Automazione e Programmazione degli Invii)**  
Fluentisâ€™s newsletter management supports automation, allowing you to schedule email sends at specific times. This is useful for coordinating campaigns with particular events, such as the launch of new products, seasonal promotions, or business updates. Additionally, it is possible to configure automatic sends even with status changes in workflows.

**Integration with the CRM (Integrazione con il CRM)**  
The newsletter management in Fluentis is closely integrated with [CRM Contacts](/docs/crm/home-crm/contacts/search-contacts). This allows for centralized management of all interactions with customers, including newsletter sends, and enriches the customer profile with information from marketing activities.

The management of newsletters in the Fluentis management system is thus a powerful tool to improve business communication, allowing for the sending of personalized and relevant messages to your customers and contacts, all integrated into the company's operational flow. This functionality not only supports marketing activities but also helps maintain constant and fruitful contact with your audience, enhancing customer relationships and boosting sales opportunities.
