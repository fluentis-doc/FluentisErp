The filter area is dedicated to hosting the list of possible data types that can be used to make a selection. The filters are typically in 'AND' condition, and it is possible to specify multiple filtering criteria simultaneously. In particular, it is possible to filter by **Name of the template** and **Object name** on which the Template is based.
