The **Distribution Lists** form allows you to search for lists already entered in Fluentis, as well as to insert new ones.

import SearchForm from './../../../import/sections/search-form.md'

<SearchForm />

The filter area is dedicated to hosting the list of possible data types that allow for selection. The filters are typically in an 'AND' condition, and it is possible to specify multiple filtering criteria simultaneously. Specifically, it is possible to filter by the **First Name** of the list, and by the **Object name** on which the Template is based, the **Contact Type**, and the **User** in Fluentis who generated the list.
