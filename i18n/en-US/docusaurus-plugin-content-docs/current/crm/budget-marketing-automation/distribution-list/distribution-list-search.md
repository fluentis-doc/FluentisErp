The **Distribution Lists** search mask allows you to search for lists already entered in Fluentis, as well as to insert new ones.

import SearchForm from './../../../import/sections/search-form.md'

<SearchForm />

The filter area is dedicated to hosting the list of possible data types through which a selection can be made. The filters are typically in 'AND' condition, and it is possible to specify multiple filtering criteria simultaneously. In particular, it is possible to filter by the **First Name** of the list, and by the **Object name** on which the Template is based, by **Contact Type**, and by the **User** that generated the list.
