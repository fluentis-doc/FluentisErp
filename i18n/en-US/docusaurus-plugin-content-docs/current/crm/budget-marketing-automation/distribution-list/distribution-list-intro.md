The **Distribution Lists** procedure allows for the creation of CRM contact lists to which **Newsletter** must be sent. Distribution lists are divided into two types:
- **Static Lists**: require the user to manually add newly created CRM contacts to the list;
- **Dynamic Lists**: calculate in real-time, based on the filters set on the SQL query associated with the list, the contacts that must be included at the time of sending the Newsletter.

The distribution lists can contain both CRM contacts and the references of the contacts themselves.
