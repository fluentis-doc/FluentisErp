Managing marketing campaigns in Fluentis is highly structured and flexible, allowing for the creation of custom workflows, defining budgets and costs, selecting target contacts, and managing the execution of campaigns in either automated or manual ways. The following is a technical explanation of how this process is managed within the software.

**Creation of the Marketing Campaign Workflow**
In Fluentis, the management of marketing campaigns is based on the creation of a workflow, which represents the flow of work for the campaign. The workflow is divided into various states, each of which can have specific actions, such as sending emails, recording interactions, or starting other marketing activities.

*Workflow States*: Each state of the workflow represents a phase of the campaign. For example, the initial state could be "Preparation", followed by "Email Sending", "Follow-up", "Results Analysis", etc.

*Predefined Actions*: Within each state, specific actions can be defined. For instance, in the "Email Sending" state, automatic sending of an email to all selected contacts can be scheduled. Actions can also include tasks such as updating the CRM, recording responses, or moving to the next state of the workflow based on the results obtained.

*Automation*: The workflow can be configured to automatically execute certain actions upon the occurrence of specific conditions. For example, if a contact does not respond to an email within a certain timeframe, the system can automatically send a reminder or update the contact's status in the CRM.

**Compilation of the Marketing Campaign**
During the creation of the marketing campaign, Fluentis allows for the filling in of all relevant details for managing and monitoring the campaign.

*Budget Definition*: It is possible to specify the total budget available for the campaign. This budget is monitored throughout the execution of the campaign to ensure that expenses remain within defined limits.

*Cost Recording*: As the campaign progresses, costs associated with each activity (such as costs for purchasing contact lists, email design expenses, etc.) can be recorded. Fluentis allows for comparing actual costs with the planned budget, providing a clear view of expenses.

*Campaign Objectives*: In addition to costs, itâ€™s possible to define the objectives of the campaign, such as the number of leads generated, the expected conversion rate, or return on investment (ROI). These parameters help evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign once completed.

**Selecting the Distribution List and Contact Selection**
Once the workflow and campaign details are defined, it is necessary to select the recipients of the campaign.

*Creation of the Distribution List*: Fluentis allows for the creation of distribution lists based on advanced segmentation of contacts. These lists can be generated using specific criteria, such as demographics, purchase history, interest in certain products or services, and more.

*Contact Selection*: From the distribution list, it is possible to select the contacts who will receive the campaign. This selection can be further refined manually or through additional filters to ensure that messages reach the most appropriate audience.

*Customization*: Fluentis also allows for personalizing the content of the campaign based on the data of individual contacts, enhancing the effectiveness of the message.

**Executing the Workflow or Manually Sending Emails**
The final phase of campaign management involves executing the workflow and sending communications to the selected contacts.

*Automatic Workflow Execution*: If the workflow has been configured for automation, Fluentis will execute the predefined actions in each state of the workflow without the need for manual intervention. This includes sending emails, managing responses, and automatically transitioning between states of the workflow based on the set conditions.

*Manual Email Sending*: If preferred, email sending can be managed manually. This can be useful in situations where a more direct control over the exact timing of communications is desired, or for ad-hoc messages not planned in the automatic workflow.

*Real-time Monitoring*: During execution, Fluentis allows for real-time monitoring of the campaign status, showing which emails have been sent, opened, or if there have been interactions from the recipients.
