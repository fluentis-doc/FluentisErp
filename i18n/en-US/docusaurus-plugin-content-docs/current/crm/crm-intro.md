### Common Buttons in Sales Document Search

All CRM document search forms allow for searching documents to view, modify, and possibly delete them or proceed with the insertion of new documents; the windows consist of a filter area and a results grid.  
In the results grids, additional columns can be added by dragging the appropriate fields from the Object navigator; it is also possible to delete columns by dragging the column header out of the grid. To make the changes permanent, it is necessary to save the Profile as default.    
The common toolbar buttons for search forms are as follows:    
| Button | Custom features |
| :-- | :--|
| *Search* | Allows you to view results within the grid after setting all desired filters. |
| *Modify* | Allows you to open and modify the document. |
| *View* | Allows you to open the document in view mode, without the ability to edit. |
| *Remove* | Allows you to delete selected documents in the grid. |
| *Open diagram* | For each document of the module, a series of Diagrams are made available that provide a global view of the connections the document has. |
| *Activity/Task* | In this section, it is possible to assign a task to be performed to an Operator or Corporate Role; the task will be displayed in the user's personal Task manager and can be managed with the Fluentis Supervisor if notification management to operators is necessary. | 
| *Documents* | By using the Documents toolbar button, you can choose to attach a document already coded in Fluentis or to create a new Document to attach.|
| *Profile Management* | Each user has the option to graphically customize the mask by adding/deleting/modifying visible fields; changes made can be saved in *Profiles*, at the level of individual users, corporate roles, or for all; it is also possible to choose the default Profile to load at each access. |
