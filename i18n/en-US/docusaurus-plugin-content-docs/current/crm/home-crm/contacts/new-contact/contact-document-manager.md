In this tab, it is possible to view the attached documents. To attach documents, there are two ways to proceed:

- using the Document toolbar button, you can choose whether to attach a document already coded in Fluentis or to create a new Document to attach.
- directly using the right mouse button in the grid and selecting Attach file (Allega file), you will create a new Document to attach.
