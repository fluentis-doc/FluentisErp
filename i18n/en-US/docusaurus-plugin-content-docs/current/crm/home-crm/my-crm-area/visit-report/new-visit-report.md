The procedure for creating a new **Visit Report** allows you to define the characteristics of the visit made by the contact.

The form is divided into two parts.
In the upper part, the following fields are present:

**Visit report type**: allows you to indicate the type of Visit Report you are entering and refers to the corresponding table, composed of *Code* and *Description*.      
**Number**: this is the number of the Visit Report, automatically assigned by Fluentis.           
**Date**: this is the date related to the visit and is set to today's date.          
**Object**: this field should indicate the reason for the visit to the customer.          
**Note**: free field for entering additional notes related to the visit.           
**Contact/Customer (Contatto/Cliente)**: this field should indicate the CRM contact or the customer to which the Visit Report refers. The label of the field and the subject of reference for the field itself change depending on whether the flag is placed on the *Crm Contact* or on the *Fluentis Account*.     
**Participants**: in this freely filled field, the individuals who participated in the meeting should be indicated.     
**Agent**: in this field, which refers to the agents' registry of Fluentis, the agent who attended the meeting should be indicated, if present.     

The lower part of the form, on the other hand, presents two tabs.

## Doc.

In this tab, the actual report created during the visit is generally filled out. This document can contain various information, based on the type of visit made. For this reason, in the grid, it is possible to select a [Template](/docs/crm/budget-marketing-automation/template/template-search) to use as the basis for the report and to complete it with the customer's information. It is therefore necessary to create the various templates in advance to have them available during the visit and to be able to use them. 
On the right side, the selected Template will be displayed, and it will be possible to fill it out. It is also possible to enter the necessary data for sending the document via email.            
For the management of the template, the following sections are available:

> - *Cancel*: cancels the last modification to the template;
> - *Restore*: restores the last modification deleted from the template.

- by directly using the right mouse button in the grid and selecting Attach file (Allega file), you enter the creation of a new Document to attach.
