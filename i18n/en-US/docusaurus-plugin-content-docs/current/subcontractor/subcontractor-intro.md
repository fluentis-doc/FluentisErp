The Subcontractor management of **Fluentis** allows for the creation of Subcontractor orders both manually from production and automatically through the confirmation of reordering proposals generated by the needs analysis procedures.
Once the orders are sent to the subcontractor suppliers, the module manages the issuance of transport documents for the materials (taking into account the materials directly provided by the subcontractors and their stock in the warehouse), and finally, the loading of purchase transport documents that will deduct from the subcontractor's warehouse.
The module is integrated with the bill of materials and allows for the management of return codes from the Subcontractor, through the organization of returns.
All is integrated with the price list management, which allows for the assignment of prices either by code or, if necessary, by code â€“ phase.
