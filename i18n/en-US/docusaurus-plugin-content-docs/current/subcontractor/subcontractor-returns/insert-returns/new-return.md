Through this form, it is possible to manually create a new return for subcontracting or modify existing ones.

The form is opened via the path **Subcontractor > Returns > New Return** or through the **New** button found in the [Search Returns](/docs/subcontractor/subcontractor-returns/search-returns) form.

The application requires you to enter the **Supplier** holding the order, using the specific account help, the **Type**, the **Number**, and the **Return date** (which usually corresponds to the current date).

**Controled**: the flag is manually activated by the user;  
**Valorized and Loaded**: these are automatically activated when the valuation and registration of the document to the warehouse are carried out in the order.

> **Estimated returns**: the button is activated after saving the mandatory data and opens the *Fulfillment from Order* form, within which the user can see all the subcontracting orders that still have partially or completely unfulfilled lines and from which returns can therefore be generated;  
> **Returns Record**:

The form contains a series of tabs:

- [Header](/docs/subcontractor/subcontractor-orders/insert-subcontractor-orders/new-subcontractor-orders) and its Procedures;  
- [Items](/docs/subcontractor/subcontractor-orders/insert-subcontractor-orders/new-subcontractor-orders);   
- [Materials](/docs/subcontractor/subcontractor-orders/insert-subcontractor-orders/new-subcontractor-orders);  
- [Summaries](/docs/subcontractor/subcontractor-orders/insert-subcontractor-orders/new-subcontractor-orders).
