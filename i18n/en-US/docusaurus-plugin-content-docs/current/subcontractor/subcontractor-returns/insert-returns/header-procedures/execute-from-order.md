In this window, which opens using the *Estimated returns* button located on the ribbon bar, it is possible to filter work orders.

In the grid below, a row appears for each work order that has not yet been fulfilled or has been partially fulfilled.  
The user, by double-clicking on the order row, has the ability to expand the lines that still need to be returned by the subcontractor, can select them or enter the quantity for each of them and press the *Transfer* button to transfer the quantities of the selected items to the grid in the *Items* tab of the work return.

*Specific buttons (Pulsanti specifici)*:  
> **Search orders**: allows applying search filters to the entire database of entered work orders that have not yet been fulfilled or have only been partially fulfilled;  
> **Transfer**: calls the procedure that transfers the selected items in the window below to the grid of the Returned Items tab of the work return;  
> **Forced Order Execution**: calls the procedure that allows the row of the work order that the user is transferring to be forcefully marked as fulfilled;  
> **Select all**: allows selecting all rows present in the right section of the window where the items to be transferred appear;
