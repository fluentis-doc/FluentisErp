In this tab, the materials that have not been used by the subcontractor, either because they are in excess or discarded, are entered.

*Specific Fields*:

**Warehouse**: in this column, the code of the Returns warehouse is displayed, taken from the job order parameters, automatically shown only if the returned quantity is entered on the material line, editable by the user;

**Template**: in this column, the code of the reason for the Returns loading is displayed, taken from the job order parameters, automatically shown only if the returned quantity is entered on the material line, editable by the user. If the materials not used by the user have been discarded, then the reason should not have a counterpart. If, however, the materials have been returned, then the reason must have a loading counterpart to indicate where to place the returned materials.

**Batch Load**: In the grid, the user can indicate which batches of materials have been used by the subcontractor. The displayed columns and the rules for using the grid are the same as those in the batch grid of the *Lots/SN* tab found in the *Items* tab.
