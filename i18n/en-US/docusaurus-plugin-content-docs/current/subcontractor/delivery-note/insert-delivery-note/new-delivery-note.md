The form opens via the path **Subcontractor > Orders > New Subcontractor Order** or through the **New** button found in the [Search Subcontractor Orders form](/docs/subcontractor/subcontractor-orders/insert-subcontractor-orders/new-subcontractor-orders).

The application requires the user to enter the **Supplier** (contractor) that the DN is issued to, using the appropriate account help available in the header of the DN. Automatically, the current **Year**, **Number**, **Date**, and **Delivery DN Type** (proposed to be the same as that entered in the *Subcontractor Parameters*), will be suggested, which can be modified by the user.
