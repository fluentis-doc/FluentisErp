The form opens via the path **Work Account > Orders > New Work Account Order (Conto Lavoro > Ordini > Nuovo Ordine di Conto Lavoro)** or through the **New** button found in the [Search C/L Orders form](/docs/subcontractor/subcontractor-orders/insert-subcontractor-orders/new-subcontractor-orders).

The application requires the user to enter the **Supplier** (contractor) that the DDT is issued to, using the appropriate account help available in the header of the DDT. Automatically, the current **Year**, **Number**, **Date**, and **Delivery DDT Type (Tipo DDT di Consegna)** (proposed to be the same as that entered in the *Work Account Parameters (Parametri di Conto Lavoro)*), will be suggested, which can be modified by the user.
