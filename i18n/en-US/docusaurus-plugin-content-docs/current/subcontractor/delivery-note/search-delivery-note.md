*Specific filters (Filtri specifici)*

**Unloaded**: this flag allows filtering for Delivery Notes that have already been downloaded from the warehouse, meaning the Delivery Notes for which the *Delivery Notes Unload* operation has been performed;  
**Printed**: this flag allows for filtering of Delivery Notes that have already been printed.  
The Delivery Note search window opens with these 2 flags disabled by default, so to view all Delivery Notes, you need to enable them.

From this form, it is also possible to create a new delivery note by clicking the [New (Nuovo)](/docs/subcontractor/delivery-note/insert-delivery-note/new-delivery-note) button.
