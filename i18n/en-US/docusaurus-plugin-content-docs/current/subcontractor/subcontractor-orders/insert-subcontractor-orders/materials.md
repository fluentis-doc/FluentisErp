The form consists of two grids that display the materials to be sent to the subcontractor for processing and the materials that will be used upon the return of the processed product. It is possible to insert coded items, non-coded items, and notes. 

The materials sent and used can be managed by the operator, and in this case, it is necessary to enter the quantity, the possible processing price, the expected return date, and the material usage date. These data are already populated if the order originates from *General Schedule* or *MRP Processing*.

## Materials to be delivered

**Item code**: indicates the material to be delivered for processing;  

:::note Note
In cases where the work order is generated by the release of a *Subcontracted planned order* or a *Production planned order* with one or more external phases, the materials to deliver will not be displayed if: the [MRP Parameters](/docs/configurations/parameters/production/mrp-parameters/mrp-parameters-intro) for the item do not exist, or the *Consider on Subcontractor* flag is not enabled in the [MRP Parameters](/docs/configurations/parameters/production/mrp-parameters/mrp-parameters-intro), or if the *Pickup type* in the [MRP Parameters](/docs/configurations/parameters/production/mrp-parameters/mrp-parameters-intro) is *Automatic*, or if in the [MRP Parameters](/docs/configurations/parameters/production/mrp-parameters/mrp-parameters-intro) the *Pickup type* is *With List* and the WIP flag is not enabled.

## Materials to be used

**Item code**: indicates the material to be used upon the return of the processed product;  
**Unit Usage**: quantity to be used for each unit of the processed product's return, in case of automatic scheduling of bills of materials; this data is populated by the system;  
**Total Usage**: total quantity to be used for complete processing in case of automatic scheduling of bills of materials; this data is populated by the system;  
**% scrap**: quantity to be used in excess that results in scrap;  
**Expected Commitment Date**: based on this date, the system plans the availability of the requirement.
