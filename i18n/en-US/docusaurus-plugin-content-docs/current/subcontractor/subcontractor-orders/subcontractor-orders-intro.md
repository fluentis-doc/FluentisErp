The Work Order can be created from planning based on external work phases declared in the production order or can be created independently.

A series of **Settings** of a predefined tabular nature and a correct parameterization of the basic algorithms are recommended before proceeding with the generation of C/L orders.

> **Tables**: it is advisable to refer to the section *Configuration > Tables > Production (Configurazione > Tabelle > Produzione)* to identify the correct settings for the Work Order module.  
> **Parameters**: the form is [C/L Parameters (Parametri C/Lavoro)](/docs/configurations/parameters/production/subcontractor-parameters).
