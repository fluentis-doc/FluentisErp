The document search form allows for the search of all documents in order to view, modify, and possibly delete them or proceed to the insertion of a new document; the window consists of a filter area and a result grid.

Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button present on the *Ribbon bar* to display the results within the result grid.

To open the details of a document, simply select it and double-click with the mouse, or click the **Modify** button (which allows entering the details and modifying them) or the **View** button (which allows entering the details and viewing them but without the ability to modify them).
