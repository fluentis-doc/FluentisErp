Here is the proposed information entered in the supplier registry, tab [Shipping (Spedizioni)](/docs/erp-home/registers/contacts/create-new-contact/accounting-data/customer-vendors-data/delivery), only if default data exists.

The combo box offers all the recipients and destinations entered in the supplier registry.

Shipping addresses (recipient/destination and carrier) can also be entered descriptively without being previously added among the contacts.
