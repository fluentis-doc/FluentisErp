- **Line type** offers the opportunity to select, from the combo-box, items with different characteristics (if you start directly by entering the item by double-clicking on the 'Item' column or by directly typing the item code, its *Class*, *Code*, and *line type - Codified Item* are automatically inserted):
> **Codified Item**: these are the items codified in the registry and can be recorded in analytic accounting and stored in the warehouse. <br />
> **Non-Codified Item**: these are descriptive items that can be recorded in analytic accounting but cannot be moved in the warehouse. <br />
> **Charge Item**: these can be codified or non-codified items and are summarized distinctly in the document summaries. If the expense item is codified and of fiscal interest, it will be moved in the warehouse; if it is non-codified or not of fiscal interest, it will not be moved in the warehouse. <br />
> **Note Item**: these are descriptive notes included in the document printout; they do not affect accounting and the warehouse.
