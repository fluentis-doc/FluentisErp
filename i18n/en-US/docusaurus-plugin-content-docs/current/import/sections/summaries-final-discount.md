**Discounts** section allows you to enter percentage discounts to apply to the total document.

Discounts entered in this section are calculated and applied to each item in the document, in the *Items > Discounts/Pricing* tab.

- **Discount Type/Description**: Allows you to choose discount types (predefined in [Discount Types](/docs/configurations/tables/general-settings/discount-types)), assigning the type priority for applying the discount and whether the discount is calculated on the taxable amount or cascaded based on previously applied discounts.
- **Priority**: Represents the priority for applying the discount; sorting is done in ascending order.
- **Cascade/Taxable Amount**: Defines whether the discount calculation uses the taxable amount (price * quantity) - (already calculated discounts) or (price * quantity).
- **Value**: Numerical value of the final discount to apply.
