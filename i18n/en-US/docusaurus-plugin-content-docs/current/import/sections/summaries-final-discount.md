The final discounts applied at the level of each individual item are distributed (or "spread") across each item line of the document. This means that the discount amount is proportionally divided among all the items present in the document, and the corresponding discount will be visible in the Items tab for each individual line.

- **Type/Description of discount (Tipo/Descrizione sconto)**: allows you to choose the types of discounts (preset in [Discount Types](/docs/configurations/tables/general-settings/discount-types)), assigning the type the priority for discount application and whether the discount is calculated on the taxable amount or cascaded from previously applied discounts.  
- **Priority**: represents the priority of discount application; the ordering to be applied occurs in ascending order.  
- **Cascade/Amount**: to define whether the calculation of the discount uses as taxable the (price * quantity) - (discounts already calculated) or (price * quantity).  
- **Value**: numerical value of the final discount to be applied.
