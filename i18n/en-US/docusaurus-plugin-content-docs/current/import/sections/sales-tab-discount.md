In this tab, the price list and discounts associated with the item line can be consulted.

In the **Price list** section, the price list from which the item has been retrieved is proposed, along with the start/end validity date.  
In the **Bracket type**, the default tier that the customer has associated for this price list is proposed; if no default tier is present, a discount tier can be manually selected to use; it is important to remember that price lists can have different discount tiers associated with the same item (quantity discounts, general discounts, etc.).

The **Manual price** flag not active means that the price list, price, and discounts of the line are all calculated automatically; if the user changes any of these, the flag will be activated.

In the **Discounts** grid, all discounts associated with the item are proposed, each with its own calculation base and assignment. Discounts can be retrieved from: the customer registry, the payment solution assigned to the document, from the price list via the price list-customer association. All proposed data can be modified.
