- **Variants**: if the selected item has variants, it will be necessary to select the desired variant from this combo box. The choice of the variant is useful for items with this particular configuration, which may have a different price from the standard price set. Consequently, the price of the item with variants may be different from the price of the item without variants. This may eventually require the management of item variants in the relevant pricing list.
