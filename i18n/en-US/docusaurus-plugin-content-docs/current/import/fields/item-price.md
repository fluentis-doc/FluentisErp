**Price**: the price is proposed from the price list entered in the contact record; the reference price list for the item itself is displayed in the *Discounts/Price Lists* tab.

The same document may contain items with prices taken from different price lists, if multiple cascading price lists are associated in the contact record (see [Contact Record](/docs/erp-home/registers/contacts/create-new-contact/accounting-data/customer-vendors-data/price-list)).

By double-clicking in the **Price Lists** field (in the *Discounts/Price Lists* tab), the user has the option to select a different price list from the default one, from which the price of the inserted item will be taken.
