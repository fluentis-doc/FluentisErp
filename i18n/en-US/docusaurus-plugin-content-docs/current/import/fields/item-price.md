- **Price**: the price is proposed from the price list entered in the contact registry; the reference price list for the item itself is displayed in the *Discounts/Price Lists* tab; the same document may contain items with prices taken from different price lists if multiple cascading price lists are associated with the subject in the registry (see [Register Printing](/docs/erp-home/registers/contacts/create-new-contact/accounting-data/customer-vendors-data/price-list)). Through a double click in the **Price list** field (in the *Discounts/Price Lists* tab), the user has the option to select a different price list from the default one, from which the price of the entered item will be taken.
