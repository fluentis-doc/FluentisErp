The table allows for the insertion of new records or searching for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

**Search Document Types**

The form consists of a filter area and a result area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results within the result grid.

**Insert Document Types**

To insert new codes, you need to click in the grid on the first empty row or press the **New** button.

For the new record, at least the mandatory fields required by the program must be filled out: the alphanumeric **Code** of the type and its **Description**, the corresponding **Standard Code**, and the **Numeration Type**. You can also enter the **Document Type** generated (purchase, production, work order), and via the flag, indicate whether the document is for **Maintenance** interventions or only for production.

For **Document Types** with the standard code *PJO* (Production Job Orders), it is possible to insert the **Production job order cost type** that will then be proposed by default for each processing of the production job order costing.
