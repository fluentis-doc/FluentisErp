The table is opened via the path **Tables > Sales > Price Range Configuration** and is used to configure prices based on the variation of certain attributes (for example: in the clothing sector, where there are items that have different costs depending on the size).

### Search the Configuration

This allows you to enter new records or search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

The form consists of a filter area and a result area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results in the result grid.

To modify/view a configuration, just double-click on the desired row or press the **Modify** button.

To insert new records, it is necessary to press the **New** button, which will open a new entry form.

### Modify/Insert Configuration

In the first part, the **Code** and **Description** of the configuration must be entered, and then the versions must be set, each with its specific data to be filled in the lower tabs.
