The table opens via the path **Tables > Sales > Invoicing Category** and is used to indicate the invoicing frequency for each customer. This data is entered in the customer contact and is used as a filter for invoicing.

It allows the insertion of new records or the search for existing ones to view, modify, or delete them.

The form consists of a filter area and a results area. Once all desired filters are set, simply click the **Search** button to display the results within the results grid.

To insert new records, you need to click on the first empty row in the grid or press the **New** button. 

The data that must be entered for each category are the **Code** of the new category, which must be unique, and its **Description**.
